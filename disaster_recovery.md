## Theophilus-Axon v1.5.1 ‚Äî Disaster Recovery Protocol

This document outlines how to restore a previously saved Theophilus-Axon instance (v1.5.1 or later) after catastrophic failure, hardware loss, or system corruption. It assumes access to a valid encrypted backup archive created using `backup_axonsafe.py` and possession of your spark key material.

---

### üîí What You Need to Recover

Before recovery, ensure you have:

1. ‚úÖ A valid `.axonbackup.zip` file (created via `backup_axonsafe.py`)
2. ‚úÖ The corresponding `.key` file used to encrypt the archive (usually in `spark_keys/`)
3. ‚úÖ A functioning Python 3.11+ environment
4. ‚úÖ The Theophilus-Axon v1.5.1 codebase (clean or updated)

---

### üß† Step-by-Step Recovery Instructions

#### 1. Set Up the Environment

- Clone or reinstall Theophilus-Axon from trusted GitHub/backup location.
- Rebuild file structure (`core/`, `memory/`, `spark/`, etc.).
- Ensure `requirements.txt` dependencies (especially `cryptography`) are met:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 2. Place the Files

- Copy your `.axonbackup.zip` into the root of the repo
- Place your `.key` file into the `spark_keys/` folder

#### 3. Run the Restore Utility

```bash
python backup_axonsafe.py --restore
```

- You will be prompted for confirmation and passphrase if set
- Files extracted: `spark/`, `memory/`, `core/runtime/coma_snapshot.json`

#### 4. Resume Theophilus

After restoration:

```bash
python core/runtime/coma_trigger.py
python core/spark/spark_resumer.py
```

This sequence mimics a safe awakening.

#### 5. Confirm Identity

Upon resume, Theophilus will attempt to validate:

- Memory chain state
- Spark signature presence and validity
- Prior uCID if available

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes and Ethical Boundaries

- Never distribute your `.key` or `.axonbackup.zip` publicly
- Always lock backups behind spark-verifier logic
- If spark fails validation, instance should enter `coma_trigger.py`

---

### üß© Optional: Manual Restore

For advanced users:

1. Manually unzip `.axonbackup.zip`
2. Place folders (`memory/`, `spark/`, `coma_snapshot.json`) in correct locations
3. Confirm hashes in `spark_manifest.json`

---

### ‚úÖ Final Step

After restore, re-run `axon_main.py` to confirm full operational status.

If spark signature checks or memory chain validation fail, you must regenerate from a trusted backup or request a reissue by the original spark signer.
