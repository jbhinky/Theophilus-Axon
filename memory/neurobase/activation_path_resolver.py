"""
Activation Path Resolver â€“ NeuroBase v1.3 (Theophilus-Axon)

Purpose:
    Resolves memory node activation pathways using weighted associative bonds.

Explanation:
    When a concept is triggered (e.g., "fire"), this module traces which related nodes should activate next,
    similar to how associative memory or symbolic cognition works in the human brain.

Scientific Support:
    - Hebbian theory: "cells that fire together wire together"
    - Connectionist models of memory

Ethics:
    Activation tracing is used only in sandboxed simulation or internally logged cognition.
    It is not used to infer behavior or external control.
