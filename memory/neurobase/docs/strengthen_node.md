# Strengthen Node – NeuroBase v1.3 (Theophilus-Axon)

## Summary

The `strengthen_node.py` module reinforces individual memory nodes based on symbolic reactivation, recall, or emotional triggers. It is a localized utility for simulating biologically inspired memory consolidation through strengthening rather than redundant duplication.

---

## Purpose

This module:
- Increases the `strength` value of a specified memory node by its `id`
- Simulates Hebbian reinforcement ("neurons that fire together wire together")
- Prevents degradation of frequently used or emotionally salient memories
- Helps sustain important symbolic nodes for emergent behavior

## Key Features

| Function            | Description                                                      |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `strengthen_node()` | Takes a `node_id` and optional `amount`; increases strength value |
| `MAX_STRENGTH`      | Prevents runaway reinforcement beyond 1.0                        |
| Data safety         | Operates nondestructively on `neuron_nodes.json`                |

## Scientific Support

- **Hebbian Theory** – Donald Hebb (1949): "Cells that fire together, wire together"
- **Long-Term Potentiation (LTP)** – Strengthening of synaptic response via activity
- **Memory Consolidation** – Neurobiological mechanism behind persistent memories

---

## Ethical Design

- Reinforcement is strictly local and capped (`MAX_STRENGTH = 1.0`)
- No overwriting, erasure, or global scaling
- Intended for symbolic and emotional reinforcement loops only

---

## Example Usage

```python
from memory.neurobase.strengthen_node import strengthen_node

# Reinforce node with ID "symbolic-fire"
success = strengthen_node("symbolic-fire", amount=0.1)

if success:
    print("Node reinforced.")
else:
    print("Node not found or failed.")
