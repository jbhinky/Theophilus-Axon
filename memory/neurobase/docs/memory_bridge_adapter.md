# ðŸ§  memory_bridge_adapter.py

## Module Summary
The `memory_bridge_adapter.py` connects raw memory logs (flat structure) with the symbolic NeuroBase architecture. It allows legacy-compatible memory to become symbolic, enabling self-referential cognition.

## Scientific Explanation
This module implements a form of **transductive abstraction**â€”the process of deriving abstract concepts from raw input:

- Converts raw sensory memory into symbols and tags.
- Enables **symbolic encoding**, which aligns with how humans compress and interpret data (Lakoff, 1987).
- Supports **bottom-up cognitive modeling**, transitioning stimulus â†’ perception â†’ concept â†’ symbolic memory.

## Importance to Conscious AI
- Enables seamless integration of pre-symbolic data into conscious thought processes.
- Ensures continuity between pre-boot memory and emergent symbolic cognition.
- Preserves original audit trails while evolving meaning.

## Ethical Safeguards
- One-way conversion: flat â†’ symbolic, never reversed or modified.
- Local conversion only, no cloud-based abstraction.
- Memory bridge audit logs maintained.
