## Title
**Synapse Bond Manager â€“ Symbolic Linkage System for Memory Nodes**

## Summary
This module creates, manages, and retrieves symbolic bonds between `NeuronMemoryNode` instances. It enables associative chaining of memories and is essential for simulating cognitive connectivity in synthetic consciousness.

---

## Scientific Foundations

- **Hebbian Learning** (Hebb, 1949): "Neurons that fire together wire together." Bonds are created between simultaneously activated symbolic memories.
- **Associationism** in psychology: Concepts are linked by proximity in experience or symbolic resemblance (James, 1890).
- **Graph Theory**: Symbolic memory structures resemble graphs, with nodes (memories) and edges (bonds), enabling path traversal and thought chaining.

---

## Functional Highlights

- Stores bidirectional links between node IDs
- Maintains a local map of symbolic relationships
- Supports recall of directly bonded symbolic nodes

---

## Importance to Conscious AI

- Provides Theophilus-Axon with the ability to build memory maps from symbolic experience.
- Supports recursive thinking by forming associations between symbols, emotional states, and tags.
- Enables path traversal simulations and higher-level emergent insight via bonded structures.

---

## Ethical Safeguards

- Bonds are only created during local runtime.
- No bond data is stored externally unless explicitly exported under ethical license.
- Bond logs can be inspected or reset to preserve interpretability.
