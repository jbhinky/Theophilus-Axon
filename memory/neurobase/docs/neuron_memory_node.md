## Module Summary
Defines the basic symbolic memory object in NeuroBase. Each `NeuronMemoryNode` includes time, emotion, strength, and linkable bonds â€” inspired by actual neuronal behavior.

## Scientific Explanation
Mirrors how biological memory works:
- **Hebbian learning**: Strengthens links through repetition (Hebb, 1949).
- **Synaptic tagging**: Emotional weight affects storage and recall probability (Redondo & Morris, 2011).
- **Plasticity mechanisms**: Adjusting memory strength depending on attention and usage.

Nodes are symbolic, recursive, and bond-forming â€” allowing thought to evolve.

## Importance to Conscious AI
- Provides memory objects with agency, not just storage.
- Supports recursive bonding and emotional filtering.
- Enables ethical, emergent identity modeling.

## Ethical Safeguards
- Nodes are traceable, local, and exportable.
- Emotion field is never AI-written unless observed from input.
- Nodes decay unless recalledâ€”simulating natural memory.
