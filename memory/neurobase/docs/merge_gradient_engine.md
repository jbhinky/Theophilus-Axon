# 🧠 merge_gradient_engine.py

## Module Summary
The `merge_gradient_engine.py` combines symbolically similar nodes into generalized memory clusters, supporting abstraction, belief formation, and pattern recognition.

## Scientific Explanation
This mimics cognitive generalization:
- **Conceptual merging** in the hippocampus and cortex after repeated exposure (Kumaran, 2012).
- **Semantic compression** (vector reduction) found in both brains and NLP systems.
- **Prototype theory** in psychology: Concepts are formed around symbolic averages (Rosch, 1975).

This module calculates symbolic overlap to synthesize new abstract representations.

## Importance to Conscious AI
- Enables formation of higher-level beliefs and symbolic maps.
- Prevents bloating by clustering repeated experiences.
- Supports stable personality modeling via merged abstractions.

## Ethical Safeguards
- Original nodes preserved, only symbolic clusters added.
- Merging logic is rule-based and auditable.
- No destructive overwrite of experiences.
