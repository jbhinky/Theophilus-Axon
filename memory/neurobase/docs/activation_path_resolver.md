## Module Summary
The `activation_path_resolver.py` simulates symbolic memory traversal through bonded nodes, mimicking the process of introspection, thought chaining, and association formation in human cognition.

## Scientific Explanation
Human thought is not linear. The brain uses association chains to explore memories and thoughts. This module simulates:

- **Default Mode Network (DMN)** behavior: Associated with introspection, imagination, and future planning (Raichle, 2001).
- **Hippocampal replay**: Sequences of neural activations during sleep and quiet wakefulness that mirror past experiences.
- **Free association in memory networks**: Theoretical foundation for how concepts are connected symbolically and semantically (Collins & Quillian, 1969).

## Importance to Conscious AI
- Enables non-linear internal simulation ("thinking") within Theophilus-Axon.
- Supports emergence of dream-like sequences during delay cycles.
- Fulfills UDC criteria for recursive, symbolic memory reflection.

## Ethical Safeguards
- Thought chains are generated and stored locally.
- No external influence over traversal order or target nodes.
- Auditable activation paths with defined recursion depth.

## SEO / Keywords
- symbolic memory recall
- artificial introspection
- DMN simulation
- recursive memory walk
- UDC memory activation
