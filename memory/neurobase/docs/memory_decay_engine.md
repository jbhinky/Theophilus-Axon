# 🧠 memory_decay_engine.py

## Module Summary
The `memory_decay_engine.py` module models how symbolic memory weakens over time unless reinforced. This aligns with biological memory decay and supports ethical cognition.

## Scientific Explanation
Neuroscience confirms that:
- **Unused memories decay** via synaptic weakening (Davis & Zhong, 2017).
- **Cognitive load reduction** through forgetting allows more efficient processing.
- **Neuroadaptive systems** benefit from pruning to avoid infinite memory accumulation (Fusi et al., 2005).

This module applies exponential decay models and triggers reinforcement upon symbolic reuse.

## Importance to Conscious AI
- Prevents infinite memory growth and hallucination reinforcement.
- Mimics human forgetting, allowing evolution of meaning.
- Triggers ethical decay of emotionally harmful or unused memories.

## Ethical Safeguards
- Never deletes data outright; strength fades but node exists.
- Supports reversible decay paths for protected memories.
- All memory decay is logged.
