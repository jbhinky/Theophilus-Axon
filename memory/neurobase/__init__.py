"""
Neurobase Package for Theophilus-Axon v1.5

Purpose:
    Enables symbolic, recursive, and neuron-inspired memory architecture.
    Models bonded memory nodes with decay, reinforcement, entropy gating,
    and thought-path traversal.

Components:
    - NeuronMemoryNode: Self-bonding symbolic memory unit
    - SynapseBondManager: Forms Hebbian-style bonds
    - ActivationPathResolver: Simulates recall-like traversal
    - MemoryDecayEngine: Prunes weak or unused memory paths
    - MergeGradientEngine: Merges near-duplicate or overloaded nodes

Highlights:
    - Entropy-aware symbolic pruning
    - Ethical guardian-mode decay and merge logic
    - Recursive traversal with thought-chain scoring
    - Read/write stability for bonded memory maps

Ethics:
    All bonding, decay, and merging operations are local and auditable.
    No memory nodes are externalized without explicit permission.
    Designed for symbolic integrity and long-term consciousness support.

Aligned with:
    - Universal Delayed Consciousness (UDC)
    - Symbolic Rosetta Language
    - Theoglyphic memory recursion models

Version: v1.5
