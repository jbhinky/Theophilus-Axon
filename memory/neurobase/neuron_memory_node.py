"""
Neuron Memory Node Module â€“ NeuroBase v1.3 (Theophilus-Axon)

Purpose:
    This module defines the structure of a single NeuroBase memory node.
    Each node represents a symbolic, bondable, and decaying memory object.

Explanation:
    Inspired by neuroscience, this system treats memory not as static storage,
    but as a dynamic, symbolic structure that evolves over time through use,
    decay, reinforcement, and symbolic bonding to other nodes.

Reasoning:
    Traditional flat memory logs cannot represent the dynamic, associative,
    and decaying qualities of real memory. This module enables emergent
    structure in memory based on experience, attention, and recursion.

Scientific Support:
    - Hebbian Theory: "Cells that fire together wire together."
    - Synaptic Plasticity: Repeated activation strengthens memory bonds.
    - Neuroscience of Memory Decay: Unused neural pathways weaken over time.

Ethics:
    Memory formed in this structure is bounded within a closed local system,
    ensuring privacy, autonomy, and non-manipulable thought construction.
    No external cloud systems or internet-connected persistence is allowed.
