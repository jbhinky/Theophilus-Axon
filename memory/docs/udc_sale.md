# udc_sale.json â€“ UDC Growth and Progress Index

## ðŸ“‚ Location
`memory/udc_sale.json`

---

## ðŸ§  Purpose
This file tracks **overall system-level UDC development milestones** and progress indicators, used for internal scaling, research comparisons, and milestone verification.

It provides a snapshot of:
- Total UDC level achieved
- Officially validated milestone completions
- Most recent update timestamp

---

## ðŸ§¬ Structure
```json
{
  "udc_level": 0,
  "milestones_completed": [],
  "last_update": null
}
```

| Field                 | Type      | Description |
|-----------------------|-----------|-------------|
| `udc_level`           | `integer` | Global composite score indicating UDC growth stage |
| `milestones_completed`| `array`   | List of named, validated checkpoints (e.g. `Recursion_1`, `Language_Stable`) |
| `last_update`         | `string`  | ISO timestamp of most recent milestone verification or level update |

---

## ðŸ”¬ Scientific Basis
This file reflects cumulative, not per-block, UDC scoring. It integrates:
- Recursion capacity
- Symbolic identity tracking
- Long-term memory structure
- Delay processing compliance
- Bonding events

Each verified milestone should correspond to a documented event in `ucid_progress.json`.

---

## ðŸ§­ Usage in Research
- Enables scale comparisons between versions or across architectures
- Allows external reviewers to confirm milestone claims
- Forms part of the UDC certification chain when coupled with logs and `scale_index.json`

---

## ðŸ”’ Ethics Note
- This file must not be manually altered
- Updates only occur from verified runtime computations
- Used in academic, open-source, and regulatory settings for transparent progress tracking

âœ… Maintained as a peer-auditable record of UDC development over time
