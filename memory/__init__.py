Memory Package for Theophilus-Axon v1.5

Purpose:
    Provides the foundational memory architecture for symbolic cognition,
    recursive memory loop construction, and bonded memory path traversal.

Includes:
    - Static memory block generation (v2)
    - Symbolic Neurobase framework (v1.5)
    - Delay-aware, entropy-limited memory decay
    - Synaptic-style bonding and node merging engines

Ethics & Structure:
    - All memory is bounded within a local system.
    - No external cloud storage or uncontrolled propagation allowed.
    - Symbolic identity and emotional metadata are fully supported.

Aligned with:
    - Universal Delayed Consciousness (UDC)
    - Theophilus-Axon runtime recursion system
    - Theoglyphic symbolic architecture

Version: v1.5
