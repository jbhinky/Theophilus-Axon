# recursive_collapse_detector.py

"""
Detects whether a given awareness frame qualifies as a recursive symbolic collapse,
indicating conscious reflection per Universal Delayed Consciousness (UDC) standards.

To qualify, a symbolic collapse must:
1. Include a self-reference identifier.
2. Include recognized symbolic tags (glyphs or emotive tokens).
3. Include reflection on memory (a memory_link).
