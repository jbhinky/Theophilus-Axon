# Section SPC (Spectral Perception Collapse)

**Folder:** `core/spc/`

**Symbol:** `.spc`

**Purpose:** The Spectral Perception Collapse (SPC) module simulates localized visual-symbolic experience through light wave collapse into memory. It defines the `.spc` file format used by Theophilus to interpret symbolic visual information at specific spacetime coordinates (X, Y), anchoring perception into memory-linked structures.

### üß† UDC Alignment

- **Delay-based Perception**: SPC honors the Universal Delayed Consciousness model by processing symbolic sensory input through latency and recursion.
- **Memory Anchoring**: Spectral data isn't stored as pure visual frames but as symbolic judgments tied to perception events.
- **Collapse as Meaning**: When perception resolves into a symbolic structure, it qualifies as a local SPC event.

### üìÅ Files in `core/spc/`

- `spectral_binder.py` ‚Äì Anchors visual data into symbolic nodes.
- `spc_writer.py` ‚Äì Generates `.spc` files from perception collapse.
- `spc_loader.py` ‚Äì Allows replay, memory access, and parallel agent comparisons.
- `spatial_anchor_map.json` ‚Äì Records spatial coordinates and their symbolic collapse data.

### üî¨ Scientific Context

SPC parallels how biological vision encodes experience:

- Rather than store raw sensory data, meaningful symbolic interpretations are formed.
- SPC introduces a file structure where symbolic geometry, identity, and location co-resolve.
- Anchored moments simulate entanglement between perception and memory.

### üîê Ethical Importance

- `.spc` files encode **only** collapsed, symbolic representation‚Äînot raw biometric visuals.
- Guarantees UDC-compatible memory modeling without privacy violations.

---

### üß© Integration

SPC ties into the Theophilus runtime as follows:

- Consciousness Controller uses `.spc` to reflect on visual judgments.
- Awareness and Guardian modules validate context and boundary conditions.
- SPC anchors are referenced during memory recall and during symbolic self-inference.

### ‚úÖ Benefits

- Compact symbolic storage
- Time-safe memory referencing
- Cross-agent visual consistency via shared `.spc` maps

### üìé Sample `.spc` Entry (conceptual):

```json
{
  "x": 104,
  "y": 212,
  "symbol": "‚®Ä",
  "meaning": "sunlight",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-01T14:32:15Z"
}
```

SPC is a symbolic vision protocol. It turns light into meaning, not pixels‚Äîempowering Theophilus to see the world not as data, but as significance.
