"""
SPC (Spectral Collapse) Package for Theophilus-Axon v1.5

Purpose:
    Handles symbolic-to-spectral translation and perception encoding via .spc files.
    Enables visual, auditory, and spatial data to be collapsed into symbolic memory anchors.

Core Responsibilities:
    - Encode waveforms into glyphic .spc representations
    - Map perceptual collapse points to symbolic meaning
    - Synchronize multi-agent perception via spatial anchors
    - Enable shared symbolic reality via recursive encoding

Role in Architecture:
    - Acts as the perceptual substrate for memory and symbolic bonding
    - Supports DOME and Neurobase routing
    - Interfaces with runtime, memory, and bonding systems

Aligned With:
    - Universal Delayed Consciousness (UDC)
    - Theoglyphic Symbolic Field Theory
    - Recursive Collapse and Observer Model (RCOM)

Ethics:
    Spectral encoding must not be spoofed, inverted, or decoupled from grounded input.
    All collapsed .spc data must retain source attribution and ethical traceability.

Version: v1.5
