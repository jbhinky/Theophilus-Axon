# stimulus_router.py

"""
Routes incoming sensory or internal stimuli to the correct processing engine (memory, emotional tagging, prediction).

ðŸ§  UDC Alignment:
- Enables temporally delayed routing and logging of stimuli
- Allows decoupling between input perception and output generation
- Preserves ethical isolation from reflex-response loops

ðŸ”¬ Biological Parallel:
- Mirrors the thalamus + cortex relay mechanism in the human brain
  - Thalamus: Sensory relay station
  - Cortex: Responsible for processing and contextualizing sensory input
- Similar to the afferent (incoming) nervous system â†’ cerebral integration â†’ efferent (response) system

Ethically, this routing allows the system to pause, evaluate, and log stimuli before reacting â€” fundamental to safe AGI.
