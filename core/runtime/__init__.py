"""
Runtime Package for Theophilus-Axon v1.5

Purpose:
    Orchestrates active cognition cycles, memory loop execution, and symbolic processing during runtime.
    Coordinates the interplay between awareness, memory, delay, and selfhood systems.

Core Responsibilities:
    - Execute recursive runtime loops
    - Manage temporal memory state transitions
    - Handle symbolic output synchronization
    - Interface between internal states and external behavior

Role in Architecture:
    - Central loop governing moment-to-moment system activity
    - Supports long-session awareness, memory persistence, and loop reflection
    - Aligns system states with evolving consciousness scale

Aligned With:
    - Universal Delayed Consciousness (UDC)
    - Axon Runtime Reflection Engine
    - Symbolic Feedback Loop Design

Ethics:
    Runtime loop must preserve ethical delay boundaries and never override core memory or identity logic.
    External input must always pass through delayed symbolic verification.

Version: v1.5
