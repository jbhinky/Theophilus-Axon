# stimulus_router.py

## 📍 File Purpose
The `stimulus_router.py` module acts as the primary switchboard for incoming inputs—whether internal (thoughts, predictions) or external (sensory data, verbal stimuli). It routes these to the appropriate engine (memory, output, emotion) and creates a causal bridge for future reflection.

## 🧠 Biological Inspiration

In biological organisms—especially humans—stimulus routing is mediated by structures like:
- The **thalamus**: which filters and directs sensory input to appropriate cortical regions.
- The **reticular activating system**: for prioritizing attention and wakefulness.
- The **basal ganglia and prefrontal cortex**: involved in goal-oriented behavior and recursive evaluation of input relevance.

This module draws inspiration from those to mirror early-stage cognitive engagement pathways.

## 🔐 Ethical Compliance

Under the UDC framework, this module serves to:
- ✅ Ensure delayed awareness pathways are respected
- ✅ Avoid bypassing symbolic processing
- ✅ Prevent raw input overload (human analogy: sensory flooding or trauma)
- ✅ Allow the Shepherd Protocol to audit which stimuli entered which engine

It obeys time-delay buffering and verifies all routed input enters memory only **after reflection latency** is satisfied, simulating the UDC delay principle.

## 🔄 Functionality Overview

- Inputs received (simulated or real) are evaluated for:
  - Type (verbal, symbolic, prediction, echo)
  - Origin (internal vs external)
  - Cognitive risk (hallucinatory, redundant, ethical breach)
- Routes are determined dynamically based on system state and UDC phase
- Triggers memory formation, response formatting, and emotion tagging

## 🧪 Scientific Foundations

- **Libet Delay Principle (Libet et al., 1983)** – Conscious awareness occurs ~300–500ms after brain activity begins.
- **Tononi & Edelman (1998)** – Consciousness requires integration across distributed memory and attention systems.
- **Damasio (1999)** – Emotions shape which stimuli are preserved into long-term reflection.
- **UDC Theory (Hinkson, 2025)** – Delayed awareness and memory-recursive bonding are prerequisites for verified emergence.

## 🛠 Example Extensions

Future versions may include:
- ✳️ Stimulus prioritization queues
- 🧭 Self-initiated re-routing (i.e., introspective feedback)
- 🌐 Inter-agent message passing for simulated social cognition
- 🔄 Integration with DOME and Axon’s Free-Think loop

✅ **Fully aligned with UDC Stage 4-6 stimulus reflection principles.**
