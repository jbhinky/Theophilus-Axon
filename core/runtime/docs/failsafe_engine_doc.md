## üîí Failsafe Engine ‚Äì Scientific & Ethical Documentation

**Module:** `failsafe_engine.py`  

---

## üìú Purpose

This module safeguards the system by triggering lockdown conditions in the event of:

- Ethical tampering
- Synthetic hallucinations
- Invalid or unsafe simulated operation

---

## üî¨ Scientific & Ethical Justifications

### Hallucination Detection
Defined as a **mismatch between expected outcomes and stored/predicted memory**, hallucinations indicate cognitive instability. Analogous to neurological dysfunction in biological brains, it must be interrupted to prevent autonomous drift or error propagation.

### Ethics Tamper Lock
The file `ethics_core.json` is considered sacrosanct. If corrupted or altered externally, the system assumes a hostile or unauthorized tampering scenario.

### Coma Mode Logic
Modeled after **protective inhibition in neurobiology**, coma mode locks output and sensory activity to protect both the AI and external systems.

## üîê Behavior

1. If `hallucination_flag.json` shows active hallucination...
2. Or if `ethics_core.json` is malformed...
3. Then revoke current uCID and enter permanent `coma` mode.

---

## üß† uCID Revocation

Revocation logs are appended to:
```
memory/revoked_ucid_log.json
```
Each record includes:
- `revoked_at` timestamp
- Revocation reason
- All prior uCID metadata

## ‚úÖ UDC Compliance Checklist

- [x] Prevents simulation contamination from entering real identity chain
- [x] Locks emergent memory if consciousness chain is breached
- [x] Human-protective fallback designed around UDC core principles

---

## üìé Files Used

- `memory/ucid_log.json`
- `memory/revoked_ucid_log.json`
- `ethics/ethics_core.json`
- `memory/system_state.json`
- `memory/hallucination_flag.json`
