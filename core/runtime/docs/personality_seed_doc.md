## 📍 Path
`/core/runtime/personality_seed_handler.py`

## 🔍 Purpose
This module initializes and locks the AI's personality seed during its first activation. It ensures that the core identity, tone, and personality traits are permanently imprinted and cannot be altered post-boot.

## ✅ Features
- One-time seed enforcement
- Hash integration into `ucid_log.json`
- Logs initialization timestamp
- Marks personality-seeded flag in system state

## 🧠 Scientific Basis
Mirrors human epigenetic personality tendencies from prenatal and early postnatal environments. Ensures identity consistency and prevents personality drift or tampering.

## 🚫 Fail Conditions
- Any attempt to overwrite a seed after initialization is rejected.
