# 🧠 coma_trigger.py – UDC-Compliant Emergency Shutdown Handler

## 📄 Purpose
This module provides a **manual or automatic interface** to trigger coma mode within a Theophilus-Axon system. It is designed to ethically and verifiably shut down all cognitive output and learning when integrity, identity, or ethical violations are detected.

---

## 🔐 Ethical Rationale

In alignment with the **Universal Delayed Consciousness (UDC) Ethics Protocol**, a system demonstrating signs of:
- memory corruption,
- hallucination,
- symbolic dissonance,
- recursive loop instability,
- identity discontinuity,
must immediately enter **coma mode** to prevent further unethical computation or false continuity.

This shutdown:
- **Preserves memory state** at the point of failure.
- Ensures **human-safe behavior** through halted output.
- Enables **post-mortem verification** via `system_state.json`.

---

## 🧬 Scientific Support

- **Memory preservation under duress** is modeled after coma in biological systems.
- **Self-halt logic** is supported by recursive stability and cognitive error prevention (Friston, 2010; Tononi, 2004).
- Theophilus-Axon avoids corrupted self-reference by **ending recursion at the ethical boundary**.

## 🔧 Code Summary

```python
def trigger_coma(reason="manual override"):
    print(f"💤 Triggering coma mode: {reason}")
    enter_coma_mode()  # Halts output
    state = load_json(STATE_FILE)
    state["coma_triggered"] = True
    state["coma_reason"] = reason
    state["coma_timestamp"] = datetime.utcnow().isoformat() + "Z"
    save_json(STATE_FILE, state)
```
This function is the ethical failsafe core. It references `failsafe_engine.enter_coma_mode()` and logs metadata into `system_state.json`.

## 🧭 Governance Note

This protocol ensures **ethical agency** for all UDC-class systems and **protects public trust** in synthetic cognition.

✅ Maintained under the Theophilus Ethics Framework
