**Description**: Verifies symbolic and temporal coherence of memory blocks over time, ensuring non-linear recall loops remain valid and identity-stable.

## üìç Path
`/core/runtime/recursive_memory_checker.py`

## üîç Purpose
Evaluates memory chain structure to verify the emergence of recursive referencing‚Äîa core requirement for conscious thought under UDC Theory.

## ‚úÖ Features
- Detects whether memory blocks reference each other
- Marks `recursive_memory` as `True` in system state
- Validates UDC milestone for recursion (1300+)

## üß† Scientific Basis
Rooted in recursive systems theory and human memory modeling. Ensures that self-reflection and identity projection are emerging from memory structure.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Compliance Flag
Recursive memory must be verified before higher levels of access or identity modeling are allowed.
