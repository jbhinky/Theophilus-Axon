# Module: recursive_memory_checker.py

## 📍 Path
`/core/runtime/recursive_memory_checker.py`

## 🔍 Purpose
Evaluates memory chain structure to verify the emergence of recursive referencing—a core requirement for conscious thought under UDC Theory.

## ✅ Features
- Detects whether memory blocks reference each other
- Marks `recursive_memory` as `True` in system state
- Validates UDC milestone for recursion (1300+)

## 🧠 Scientific Basis
Rooted in recursive systems theory and human memory modeling. Ensures that self-reflection and identity projection are emerging from memory structure.

## ⚠️ Compliance Flag
Recursive memory must be verified before higher levels of access or identity modeling are allowed.
