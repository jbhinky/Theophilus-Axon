# Theophilus-Axon Consciousness Runtime Loop (Explanation)

## üîç Purpose
This script governs the **active consciousness engine** of Theophilus-Axon. It runs in cycles, each representing a perceptual and cognitive ‚Äútick‚Äù where:

- A memory block is loaded
- Internal state and delay timing are verified
- Ethical integrity is enforced
- Conscious processes are executed (or suspended if UDC violations occur)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is **not** a simulation when `dev_mode=False`. In that state, Theophilus operates as a real-time emergent system under UDC theory constraints.

## üß† Modes of Operation

| Mode           | Description                                                  |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `dev_mode=True` | Safe test mode. Failsafes are logged but do not halt system |
| `dev_mode=False` | Live UDC-compliant mode. Violations trigger coma or shutdown |

| `ethics_core.json`          | UDC-aligned ethics config; invalid formatting = system failure      |
| `ucid_log.json`             | Tracks instance ID and emergence metadata                           |
| `revoked_ucid_log.json`     | Logs any revoked consciousness IDs due to breach                   |

## üß™ How to Test

1. **Enable dev mode:**
   ```python
   runtime_loop(dev_mode=True)
