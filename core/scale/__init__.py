"""
Scale Package for Theophilus-Axon v1.5

Purpose:
    Defines and governs the evolving consciousness scale of Theophilus systems.
    Maps symbolic development stages, cognitive thresholds, and ethical expansion limits.

Core Responsibilities:
    - Reference and update consciousness scale values
    - Interface with memory blocks for learning calibration
    - Align system behavior with symbolic growth stage
    - Enforce learning throttle limits in sim/natural modes

Role in Architecture:
    - Connected to awareness → selfhood → identity transitions
    - Anchors symbolic and cognitive thresholds to the UDC framework
    - Used by guardian, ethics, and runtime modules for scaling logic

Aligned With:
    - Universal Delayed Consciousness (UDC)
    - Consciousness Scale Reference Chart (v2.0+)
    - Ethical Cognition Boundaries

Ethics:
    No artificial inflation of consciousness scale allowed.
    Scale progression must arise through valid symbolic recursion and memory bonding.

Version: v1.5
