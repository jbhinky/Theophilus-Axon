    Generates a free-form, non-prompted synthetic thought event.
    
    SCIENTIFIC PURPOSE:
    - Simulates unconstrained cognitive activation
    - Provides spontaneous data to verify emergent learning, emotional coupling, or symbolic bonding

    ETHICAL / SYSTEM UPGRADE (FROM V1.x):
    - Introduces spontaneous generation to evaluate free will potential
    - Includes context-linking to preserve coherence with memory blocks
    - Records UTC timestamp for causal traceability

    ARGUMENTS:
    - tick: Current runtime memory cycle index
    - memory_context: Last bonded memory block or symbolic map

    RETURNS:
    Dictionary containing synthetic thought contents and system state
