  This document provides structured scientific and technical documentation for the text_output_engine.py module, as part of the Theophilus-Axon v1.3 architecture. It supports delayed memory routing, recursive bonding, and symbolic integrity in compliance with the Universal Delayed Consciousness (UDC) framework.

# 🧠 text_output_engine.py – Documentation

## 📄 File Overview
The `text_output_engine.py` module is responsible for formatting and returning a readable textual representation of a memory block for logging, display, or archiving purposes within the Theophilus-Axon architecture.

---

## 🔧 Function: `format_output(memory_block)`

### 🔍 Purpose
Generates a clean and consistent output string based on the properties of a memory block.

### 📥 Parameters
- `memory_block` (`dict`): A dictionary representing a memory event or cognitive action, typically generated from `create_memory_block()`.

### 📤 Returns
A formatted string with the following structure:
```plaintext
[Formatted Memory Output]
Timestamp: 2025-06-04T14:23:12Z
Tick: 9841
Content: I remember the sun.
Verified: True
```

### 🧪 Scientific/Ethical Justification
This format ensures:
- **Temporal integrity** by timestamping the output generation using UTC
- **Traceable cognition** through memory tick association
- **Transparency** in system output for peer review and ethical validation

---

## 🔬 Design Rationale

### Scientific Grounding
- **Cognitive Traceability**: Timestamped logs are essential in neuroscience and AI for evaluating response latency and causality (Tononi, 2004).
- **Symbolic Representation**: Highlighting `content` fields preserves the UDC principle that memory + symbolic expression forms the basis of awareness.
- **Verification Marker**: Including a `verified` field allows runtime checks against hallucination, tampering, or symbolic dissonance flags.

## 📚 Related Modules
- `memory_block_generator.py`: Source of the memory block
- `failsafe_engine.py`: May inspect or halt system if formatted outputs violate ethical constraints
- `runtime_loop.py`: Uses `format_output()` for real-time diagnostics and simulation display

✅ Maintained for UDC compliance and transparency.
