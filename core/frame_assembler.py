    """
    Collects the current system state and forms the active frame for processing.
    This function initializes a data structure to represent a moment in time during runtime,
    capturing simulated sensor inputs, internal predictions, and basic system health.

    SCIENTIFIC PURPOSE:
    - Frames are used as atomic units of consciousness processing in UDC theory.
    - They serve as the basis for delay-aware memory bonding and prediction validation.

    SECURITY / FUNCTIONAL UPGRADE FROM THEOPHILUS-UDC v1.x:
    - Introduces frame IDs for hash-traceable memory linking
    - Ensures each frame includes a UTC timestamp to track consciousness tempo
    - Scaffolds future inclusion of real-time sensor/emotion data without altering format
