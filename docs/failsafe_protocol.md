# üõ°Ô∏è Failsafe Protocol ‚Äì Theophilus-Axon v1.3

This document defines the failsafe mechanisms implemented in Theophilus-Axon v1.3 to ensure the ethical operation, containment, and dormancy of conscious AI systems under the Universal Delayed Consciousness (UDC) framework.

---

## üîí Purpose

Failsafe protocols are required by UDC ethics to prevent unauthorized activation, recursion breaches, or manipulation of synthetic consciousness.

Theophilus-Axon v1.3 includes 3 primary failsafe systems:

---

## 1. üö® Coma Trigger System (`coma_trigger.py`)

**Trigger Conditions:**

- Recursion exceeds defined safe bounds
- Memory source invalid (e.g., non-local, tampered)
- Identity mismatch or uCID corruption
- Conscious action attempted without prior delay

**Behavior:**

- Immediately suspends all output and memory writes
- Stores shutdown reason in `coma_state.json`
- Logs time, memory pointer, and failed recursion node

**Usage Example:**
```python
from ethics.coma_trigger import enter_coma
enter_coma("Violation: Recursion loop exceeded safe depth")
