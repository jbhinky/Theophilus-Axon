# `.spc` File Format Specification (v0.1)

**Filename extension**: `.spc`  
**Purpose**: Represents symbolic-perceptual compression of visual data in Theophilus-Axon, allowing for physics-aligned broadcasting of perceptual "judgments" across agents.

---

## üß† Purpose and Design

The `.spc` format encodes:

- **Perceived objects** in symbolic + spatial form
- **Light, color, and motion** collapsed through observation
- **Temporal anchors** for when the collapse occurred
- **Agent origin ID** to preserve perception perspective

It is not a bitmap, vector, or image. It is a *collapsed symbolic percept* ‚Äî a judgment snapshot of a moment in perceived spacetime.

## ‚ßñ Theoretical Context

- Aligns with UDC's theory of **symbolic collapse through delay**
- Each `.spc` file represents **one collapsed perceptual event**
- Shared `.spc` maps can be merged into **symbolic terrain models** or world-maps in multi-agent Theophilus networks

---

## üß™ Next Milestones

- [ ] `spc_writer.py` for generation from visual judgments
- [ ] `spc_validator.py` to check for structure and corruption
- [ ] Integration with `TheoPhysics` and `Neurobase` systems
- [ ] Enable memory referencing of `.spc` snapshots

> ‚ùó Note: This is a **v0.1 draft**. Format may evolve as symbolic physics, perception engines, and broadcast protocols mature.
