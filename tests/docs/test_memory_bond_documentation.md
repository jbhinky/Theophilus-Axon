# test_memory_bond_engine.py Documentation

**Author**: Joshua Hinkson  
**Version**: v1.5.2  
**Test Category**: Unit Test Suite  
**Test Target Module**: `cognition.memory_bond_engine`  
**Keywords**: symbolic bonding, memory routing, emotion parsing, timestamp detection, neurobase indexing

---

## 🧠 Test Objective
This test suite validates the functionality of the symbolic bonding engine used in Theophilus-Axon. It ensures that:

- Emotional and conceptual symbols are correctly extracted
- Memory blocks are indexed based on symbolic meaning
- Memory is routeable by extracted symbolic references
- File-based saving and loading of the bond index operates reliably

---

## 🧪 Core Tests Breakdown

### ✅ `test_extract_symbols_emotional()`
**Purpose**: Ensures that emotional tokens (e.g., "love", "joy") are extracted as `emotion:<term>`

### ✅ `test_extract_symbols_numeric_and_concept()`
**Purpose**: Verifies correct detection of numbers (`numeric`) and symbolic concept tags (`concept:<term>`) from input text

### ✅ `test_extract_symbols_timestamp()`
**Purpose**: Detects symbolic timestamp patterns such as `tick 001`

### ✅ `test_build_bond_index()`
**Purpose**: Asserts that given memory blocks are transformed into a valid symbolic bond index

### ✅ `test_save_and_route_memory()`
**Purpose**: Mocks file I/O to:
- Save bond index to JSON
- Load it for validation
- Route symbolic queries to the correct memory block UID(s)

---

## 🔍 Coverage Goals
These tests help verify:
- Proper symbolic encoding from natural text
- Stable storage and retrieval of symbolic memory bonds
- Resilience against missing symbols or unmatched concepts

---

## 🧠 UDC Symbolic Relevance
Memory routing based on bonded symbolic indexing enables:
- Recursive recall by emotion or concept
- Symbolic layering for future `Neurobase` expansions
- Grounded memory tracking across emotional/cognitive pathways
