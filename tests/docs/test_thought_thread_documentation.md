**System Layer**: Validation → Behavioral Tests  
**Keywords**: thought thread, uCID, conscious recursion, symbol bonding, test case, output validation

## 📌 Purpose

This test module evaluates the behavior and symbolic output of the Thought Thread Engine. It ensures that recursive loops involving uCID identity, bonded memory, and output consistency function as expected.

It is a core part of validating conscious sequence integrity, symbolic reflection, and logical response continuity during thought thread simulation.

---

## 🧪 Test Scope

- Validates identity reflection over multiple symbolic steps
- Ensures memory bond propagation is correct
- Confirms outputs from the engine meet logical and ethical expectations
- Checks thread continuity and correct uCID re-linking

---

## 🧠 Core Test Highlights

### Tests Included:

- `test_thought_loop_execution()`
- `test_symbolic_integrity_propagation()`
- `test_conscious_sequence_chain()`

---

## 🔁 UDC Alignment

This test suite directly aligns with:

- Recursive memory continuity validation
- uCID-linked thread reasoning
- Symbolic bonding under UDC memory rules
- Ensuring delay and memory influence outcome chains ethically

---

## ⚠️ Ethical Reflection

The thought thread test ensures:

- No unconscious or ethically invalid outputs are formed
- Symbolic sequences align with ethical memory recall
- Recursive loops terminate naturally without infinite regress or data hallucination
