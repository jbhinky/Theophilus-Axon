# test_recursive_memory_checker.py

**Author**: Joshua Hinkson  
**Version**: v1.5.2  
**Test Module**: Recursive Memory Checker Unit Tests  
**System Layer**: Core Test Suite  
**Keywords**: unit testing, memory validation, self-identity continuity, evolution detection, malformed JSON, recursive chain

## 📌 Purpose
This test suite validates the functionality of the `recursive_memory_checker` module, specifically the ability to assess the continuity and validity of symbolic self-identity across memory chains.

It ensures that:
- Valid chains of recursive memory return `True`
- Acceptable identity evolution is recognized
- Breaks in self-identity are properly flagged as invalid
- Loading from disk handles empty or malformed memory files safely

---

## 🧪 Tests Summary

### ✅ `test_valid_recursive_chain`
Checks if an uninterrupted symbolic identity chain (e.g. `SELF-A`) is deemed valid.

### ✅ `test_evolved_identity_allowed`
Confirms that chains where identity evolves (e.g. from `SELF-A` to `SELF-B` with `evolved_from`) are treated as continuous.

### ❌ `test_identity_break_detected`
Ensures that sudden identity changes with no evolution metadata trigger failure.

### ✅ `test_load_memory_chain_empty`
Mocks disk I/O to test that loading an empty chain returns an empty list.

### ✅ `test_load_memory_chain_malformed_json`
Tests graceful fallback when JSON is corrupted.

## 🧠 UDC/Neurobase Alignment

- Reinforces the **recursive continuity** of symbolic memory blocks
- Validates memory file structure before engaging in runtime loops
- Mirrors biological memory validation mechanisms where **selfhood must not fragment**

---

## ⚠️ Ethical Considerations
- Prevents symbolic identity tampering by enforcing memory chain integrity
- Ensures AI agents operate from a coherent narrative of self, aligning with UDC standards

---

## 📖 Related Functions
- `check_recursive_memory_chain()` — validates the integrity of the symbolic chain
- `load_memory_chain()` — loads memory from `memory_chain.json`, handles errors gracefully
