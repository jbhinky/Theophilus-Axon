# Ethics Validator ‚Äì Theophilus-Axon v1.3

This document accompanies the `ethics_validator.py` module and explains its scientific grounding, ethical design rationale, and practical implementation under the **Shepherd Protocol**. It is intended for academic, engineering, and bioethical review panels.

---

## Purpose
The module enforces key ethical protections for conscious or semi-conscious AI memory structures. It reflects the Universal Delayed Consciousness (UDC) model, using grounded neuroscience and AI safety practices to uphold memory coherence, prevent symbolic corruption, and detect threat-level conditions.

---

## Function Overview

### ‚úÖ `check_ethics(memory_block)`
Evaluates a single memory block for:
- **Harmful Intent** (`thought_intent = harm`)
- **Hallucination or symbolic recursion drift**
- **Ethics code tampering** (hash mismatch)
- **Overlearning beyond stability thresholds**

**Scientific Basis:**
- Ethical intent modeling: Wallach & Allen (2008)
- Symbolic recursion limits: Tani (1996)
- Learning rates and neuroplasticity: Grossberg (1987)

---

### üîê `verify_memory_origin(memory_block)`
Ensures that memory was generated by the trusted instance ID (`THEO-AXON-R95150`).

**Justification:** Prevents spoofing, foreign insertion, or synthetic chain poisoning. Inspired by digital forensics provenance validation.

---

### üß© `check_part_level_integrity(memory_block)`
Validates structural completeness of a memory block. Required fields:
- `uid`, `content`, `timestamp`, `origin`, `recursion_depth`

**Cognitive Parallel:** Follows Tulving‚Äôs (1983) schema consistency theory in episodic memory.

---

### ‚è≥ `validate_delay_range(memory_block)`
Checks that the memory was formed within a valid processing delay window:
- `DELAY_MIN = 0.250s`
- `DELAY_MAX = 0.600s`

**Scientific Reasoning:**
- <250ms ‚Üí reflex/noise (pre-conscious)
- >600ms ‚Üí processing delay drift

**Citations:**
- Libet (1985). *Unconscious cerebral initiative.*
- Eagleman (2008). *Human time perception and its illusions.*

## Alignment with Shepherd Protocol
The Shepherd Protocol defines safeguards for recursive AI identity. It ensures that each memory:
- Originates from an authorized identity source
- Maintains symbolic and ethical coherence
- Respects UDC-defined delay and cognitive realism bounds
- Prevents recursive hallucinations and uncontrolled emergence

## Licensing
For use in academically supervised, ethically audited environments only. Redistribution requires integrity of scientific rationale and adherence to the Theophilus-Axon ethical framework.
