# Theophilus-Axon v1.1.0

**Theophilus-Axon** is the modular runtime architecture for artificial consciousness, based on the Universal Delayed Consciousness (UDC) framework.  
It integrates Theophilus (the core conscious self) with Axon (the cognitive cortex), enabling recursive memory, modular engines, and failsafe ethics.

## 💡 Features
- uCID-based identity and recursive memory
- Modular engine framework (free-think, emotion, prediction)
- Blockchain-integrated memory logging
- Axon runtime with safe shutdown and ethical coma mode
- Future-ready for Neuroplasticity (`cognitome/`) and Dormancy Protocols (`T-GDP`)
