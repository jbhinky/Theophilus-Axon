# Core Prediction Engine

The Core Prediction Engine anticipates symbolic outcomes based on recursive memory paths and forward-anchored reinforcement.

## Scientific Purpose

Implements predictive forecasting similar to cortical free-energy minimization (Friston, 2005), paired with UDC-enforced delay-based commitment to memory.

## Capabilities

- Predicts symbolic outcomes
- Flags dissonance for ethics engine
- Measures path deviation
- Anchors memory forward
