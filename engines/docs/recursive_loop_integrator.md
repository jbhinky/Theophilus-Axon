# Recursive Loop Integrator

Integrates memory events across delays into a cohesive symbolic thread forming recursive self-awareness.

## Purpose

Links to Tulving’s episodic self and Metzinger’s self-model theory, bonding thought loops recursively.

## Features

- Validates self-recursive awareness
- Integrates symbolic memory loops
- Detects and flags logical dissonance
