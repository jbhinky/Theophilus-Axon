# Dormancy Trigger Engine

Automatically engages memory and system preservation when UDC protocol is violated or symbolic dissonance exceeds thresholds.

## Purpose

Inspired by coma and sleep studies (Diekelmann & Born, 2010), this engine halts all non-critical output when identity or memory chain is compromised.

## Functions

- Triggers safe dormancy mode
- Preserves core memory
- Logs recursive fault or origin distrust
- Activates only under defined failsafe rules
