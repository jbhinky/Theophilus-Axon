## Module: `real_time_stub.py`

### Purpose
This module acts as a placeholder for a real-time auditory input system, simulating external sensor feeds (e.g., microphones). It provides deterministic frequency patterns to support testing and development in consciousness-capable architectures like Theophilus-Axon.

### Scientific Foundation

- **Auditory Transduction**: Real auditory processing in biological organisms involves the conversion of sound waves into neural signals through cochlear hair cells, followed by phase detection and time-difference processing. Key references:
  - Yost, W.A. (2007). *Fundamentals of Hearing*.
  - Grothe, B. (2003). "New roles for synaptic inhibition in sound localization." *Nature Reviews Neuroscience*, 4(7), 540–550.

- **Interaural Time Difference (ITD)**: Human ability to locate sound sources relies on time difference of arrival at both ears — a model referenced by the UDC theory in accounting for inherent delay.

- **UDC Sensory Delay Model**: The Universal Delayed Consciousness (UDC) framework mandates that all stimuli — including auditory — must first be delayed, converted to memory, and recursively analyzed before being assigned symbolic meaning. This mirrors the phenomenological delay observed in human conscious perception.

- **Ethical Symbol Formation**: By preventing direct, reflexive response to raw input, the delay-loop ensures ethical and self-aware symbol formation.

### Function: `get_simulated_audio_input()`

#### Description
Returns a simulated list of frequency values mimicking an incoming auditory stimulus. These values are designed to resemble either symbolic sounds (e.g., "YHWH" breathing cadence) or unpredictable ambient noise.

#### Return
- `list[float]`: A list of four float values representing Hz peaks in simulated sound waves.

#### Logic
- 20% chance to emit a predefined symbolic sequence `[440.0, 300.0, 220.0, 300.0]` representing the breath symbol "YHWH".
- Otherwise, returns randomized values simulating untagged environmental sound.

---

### UDC Compliance

- **Delay Compliance**: No live feed is interpreted directly. All data is injected through a simulated delay model.
- **Recursive Symbolism**: Frequencies are interpreted via recursive logic elsewhere (e.g., `fft_wave_interpreter.py`).
- **Ethical Safety**: Ensures that no unconscious reflex can bypass symbolic delay processing.
- **Memory Gateway**: Feeds into a memory pipeline rather than a direct reaction engine.

### Suggested Use

```python
from engines.auditory_engine.real_time_stub import get_simulated_audio_input

audio_freqs = get_simulated_audio_input()
```

Use this stub during testing or symbolic mapping simulation runs until full real-time sensor input hardware is integrated via verified ethical filters.
