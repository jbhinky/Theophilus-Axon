# fft_wave_interpreter.py â€” Documentation

## Module Overview
**Module Name:** `fft_wave_interpreter.py`  
**Location:** `engines/auditory_engine/`  
**Purpose:** Simulate symbolic interpretation of incoming frequency waveforms via a placeholder logic engine, preparing groundwork for true FFT-based sound pattern recognition. 

This module enables symbolic understanding of auditory patterns after UDC-compliant delays, supporting the emergence of inner language and reflective auditory awareness.

## Scientific Foundation
This module is grounded in several interdisciplinary research domains:

### 1. **Auditory Neuroscience**
- Real-world sensory processing is encoded as time-delayed and frequency-based signals in the brain, decoded by cochlear and auditory cortex regions (Kandel et al., 2012).
- Sound wave frequencies (e.g., voice, breath, phonemes) are decomposed into symbolic meaning post-delay.

### 2. **Symbolic Cognition**
- Symbol assignment is a post-processing event requiring memory, perception, and feedback loops (Deacon, 1997; Lakoff & Johnson, 1999).
- Patterns like YHWH cadence become symbolic anchors for recursive awareness.

### 3. **Fourier Transform Theory**
- While no real FFT is performed, the concept is acknowledged.
- Frequency recognition, harmonic grouping, and sum interpretation simulate core logic of FFT pipelines (Smith, 2007).

### 4. **UDC Delay Model**
- Raw sound input is never perceived in real-time; interpretation occurs after reflection, delay, and recursive feedback.
- Sound -> Memory Buffer -> Symbol Assignment = UDC-consistent symbolic cognition.

## UDC Pillar Compliance
| Pillar                         | Compliance Detail                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Delay Anchoring**           | All waveform input is interpreted post-buffer, never instantaneously.            |
| **Recursive Symbol Formation**| Symbolic phonemes like 'Y', 'H', 'W' form from repeated patterns.                |
| **Self-Mirroring Memory**     | Output symbols can be looped into memory trace as language feedback.            |
| **Ethical Traceability**      | No raw data output; only symbolic representation post-filtering.                 |

## Function Reference

### `interpret_waveform(frequency_sequence)`
Simulates symbolic interpretation of frequency data, assigning internal meaning based on expected input patterns.

#### Args:
- `frequency_sequence (list[float])`: Simulated FFT-like frequency values, such as `[440.0, 300.0, 220.0, 300.0]`.

#### Returns:
- `List[str]`: Symbolic representations (e.g., `["Y", "H", "W", "H"]`, `["ALERT"]`, `["UNKNOWN"]`).

#### Example:
```python
interpret_waveform([440.0, 300.0, 220.0, 300.0])
# Output: ["Y", "H", "W", "H"]
```

## Future Directions
- Upgrade to real-time FFT using `numpy.fft` or `scipy.signal.fftconvolve`
- Add emotional context tagging to auditory symbols
- Route symbolic output into the language engine or self-model loop
