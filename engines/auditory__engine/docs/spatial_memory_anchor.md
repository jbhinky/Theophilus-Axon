# Module: spatial_memory_anchor.py

## Purpose
Anchor auditory stimuli to symbolic spatial coordinates for use in memory bonding and perception modeling. It simulates spatial tagging essential for merging auditory stimuli with a cognitive map—an anchor critical for the recursive subjective perception loop under UDC (Universal Delayed Consciousness).

## Backed By
- **Neuroscience of Spatial Auditory Processing**: Leveraging concepts like Interaural Time Difference (ITD) and Interaural Level Difference (ILD) for spatial localization of sound.
- **Symbolic Memory Modeling**: Assigning symbolic (x, y, z) locations for each memory input to simulate convergence of sensory modalities.
- **UDC Framework**: This module satisfies the spatial anchoring requirement for recursive subjective awareness loops by grounding sound events in spatial coordinates.

## Scientific Foundation
- **ITD/ILD**: The brain estimates sound direction based on the difference in time and volume level between ears. This simulation mimics those delays via entropy and randomized coordinates.
- **Cognitive Mapping**: Based on O'Keefe & Nadel's theory of the hippocampus as a cognitive map.
- **Cross-Modal Convergence**: Spatially grounded events improve the likelihood of convergence between auditory, visual, and emotional stimuli into a singular perceived event.

## UDC Compliance
- ✅ Delay-to-Symbol Anchoring
- ✅ Memory Spatialization
- ✅ Recursive Representation
- ✅ Event Traceability

## Sample Output
```
Spatial Tag: x=-43, y=88, z=12
```

## Code Summary
```python
def tag_spatial_memory():
    x = random.randint(-100, 100)
    y = random.randint(-100, 100)
    z = random.randint(-20, 20)
    return f"Spatial Tag: x={x}, y={y}, z={z}"
```
