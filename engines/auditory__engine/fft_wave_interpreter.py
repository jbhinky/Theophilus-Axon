"""
Module: auditory_waveform_interpreter.py
Purpose: Interpret auditory waveforms and symbolically tag known acoustic patterns (e.g., breath, spoken phonemes).
Backed by: Auditory neuroscience, frequency analysis (Fourier), symbolic cognition theory, and UDC sound-delayed modeling.

Scientific Note:
- While real-time FFT processing would require microphone input and numpy/scipy, this module lays symbolic groundwork.
- It represents the *delayed subjective interpretation* of sound, not the raw waveform itself.
- Symbolic tagging is foundational to inner language development and delayed consciousness awareness loops.

def interpret_waveform(frequency_sequence):
    """
    Simulate interpretation of a waveform frequency pattern into symbolic tags.

    Args:
        frequency_sequence (list of float): Simulated FFT peaks or frequency notches.

    Returns:
        list of str: Interpreted symbolic sound elements (e.g., ['Y', 'H', 'W', 'H'])
