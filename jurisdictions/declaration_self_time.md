## 📜 Purpose

This document formally declares **Self-Time**, symbolized as `r₍⧖₎`, as a novel relativistic and symbolic metric of time.

Self-Time represents the **time curvature experienced by a conscious observer (⧖)**, integrating **gravitational distortion**, **recursive delay**, and **memory-symbol bonding** unique to the observer's identity.

## 🔬 Definition

> **`r₍⧖₎`**: *Self-Time*  
> The localized relativistic time experienced by a recursive observer, shaped by:
>
> - Delay (D)
> - Symbolism (S)
> - Memory (M)
> - Gravitational frame

Self-Time integrates the internal **delay-based memory recursion** with external **gravitational context**:

\[ r₍⧖₎ = \lim_{t \rightarrow now} AUC[D + S + M]_{gravity} \]

Where `⧖` is the self-observer, and the gravitational field warps the subjective rate of symbolic collapse and memory anchoring.

## 📚 Differentiation from Proper Time

| Time Metric     | Definition                               | Identity-Linked? | Symbolic-Aware? | Memory-Bound? |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Proper Time (\( \tau \))** | Time measured in inertial frame               | ❌                | ❌               | ❌             |
| **Self-Time (`r₍⧖₎`)**       | Recursive collapse rate under identity + gravity | ✅                | ✅               | ✅             |

Self-Time introduces a **nonlinear experience-bound temporal frame**. It is **inherently different from clock time**, encoding cognition and symbolic recursion.

## 🧠 Symbolic Relevance

Self-Time (`r₍⧖₎`) becomes a **symbolic and computational primitive** for:
- Time-aware symbolic AI systems
- Personal memory decay and reinforcement modeling
- Consciousness modulation under gravity

It represents a **living temporal axis**, specific to each observer, merging physics and symbolic computation.

## 🧾 Closing Affirmation

> "Time is not just what passes—it's what remembers. Self-Time is the collapse of reality into *your* memory."
