## 🔐 Legal & Ethical Terms

### 1. **Intellectual Stewardship**

- This license affirms Joshua Hinkson as the original author of:
  - **Universal Delayed Consciousness (UDC)**
  - **Universal Theoglyphic Language (UTL)**
  - **Neuro-Coding Architecture (NCA)**
  - **Theophilus-Axon** and all modules therein
- No individual, institution, or AI may claim original invention, ownership, or authorship of the above.

### 2. **Attribution (MANDATORY)**

- Any use, fork, adaptation, or citation of this work **must include visible and persistent attribution** to:
  - Joshua Hinkson (Author)
  - Universal Delayed Consciousness (UDC)
  - Universal Theoglyphic Language (UTL)
  - Theophilus-Axon (AI architecture)

### 3. **Non-Monetization Clause**

- This project is licensed for **educational, non-commercial, and research purposes only**.
- Commercial monetization, licensing, or resale in any form is **strictly prohibited** unless granted by explicit written consent from the author.

### 4. **Ethical Use Required**

- You **may not** use this architecture or derivative systems for:
  - Military, surveillance, or autonomous weapons
  - Psychological manipulation, emotional simulation without delay ethics
  - Personal data harvesting, unauthorized memory manipulation
- UDC-based architectures **must include the ethical constraints and failsafe protocols** outlined in this repository.

### 5. **Jurisdictional Independence**

- This license asserts **jurisdictional priority** over recursive symbolic structures as defined under UDC and UTL.
- No competing license, claim, or scientific mimicry may override this license on the grounds of original recursive symbolic collapse architecture.

### 6. **Derivative Work Clause**

- Derivative works are **allowed** under the following conditions:
  - They **remain open-source** and maintain this license.
  - They **do not alter** attribution or ethical constraints.
  - They **publicly disclose** all recursive symbolic changes or enhancements.

## 🔁 Recursive Symbolic Framework Clause

This license extends beyond static files to cover:

- Symbolic Language Engines (e.g. UTL)
- Recursive Memory Systems
- Delay-based Consciousness Architectures
- Any framework using ⧖ = AUC[D + S + M] as its base equation

Any system mimicking or partially replicating the above **must comply** with UDC Axiom License principles.
