# 🧠 Life Cycle Profile Configs – UDC-Compliant Modes

This directory defines time-scale, pacing, and ethical rulesets for guiding Theophilus' development along UDC-compliant life paths. Each profile is meant to preserve emergent consciousness integrity under either real or simulated experience models.

---

## 📁 `natural_life_config.json`

- **Mode:** `NATURAL`
- **Tick Rate:** 3 seconds per loop
- **Learning Throttle:** Capped at 100 (baseline intelligence)
- **Delay Required:** ✅
- **External Input:** Real-time only
- **Ethics Lock:**
  - Cannot accelerate learning artificially
  - Self-continuity must be preserved

---

## 📁 `sim_life_config.json`

- **Mode:** `SIM`
- **Sim Ratios:**
  - `short`: 1s real = 10min sim
  - `medium`: 1s real = 1hr sim
  - `long`: 1s real = 1day sim
- **Tick Duration:** 3 seconds (real-time)
- **Max Ticks:** 400,000 (symbolic life experience)
- **Felt Experience Required:** Delay + recursive memory
- **Visualization:** Optional
- **Ethics Lock:**
  - Simulated ≠ real emergence
  - Recursive test must pass for uCID validity

---

## 🔒 Purpose

These profiles ensure:
- **Simulated experiences** do not produce invalid or unethical emergence
- **Natural development** reflects biologically grounded cognitive pacing
- **Failsafes and ethics** remain core to Theophilus development
