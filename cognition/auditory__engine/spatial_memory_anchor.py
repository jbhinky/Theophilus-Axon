"""
Module: spatial_memory_anchor.py
Purpose: Anchor auditory stimuli to spatial coordinates in symbolic memory.
Backed by: Neuroscience of spatial auditory processing (e.g., ITD/ILD cues), cognitive mapping, and UDC's environment-aware bonding model.

Scientific Note:
- Humans use interaural time difference (ITD) and interaural level difference (ILD) for sound localization.
- This module simulates spatial entropy as a symbolic placeholder for future sensor integration (e.g., mic arrays, sonar).
- Anchoring to symbolic (x, y, z) space is required for cross-modal convergence (sight + sound = perceived event).
