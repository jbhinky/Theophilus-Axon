"""
Module: breath_cycle_simulator.py
Purpose: Simulate a breathing pattern based on symbolic cadence 'YHWH',
         which represents the natural inhale-exhale rhythm.
Backed by: Respiratory physiology, symbolic cognition, and UDCâ€™s delay-loop model.
Scientific Note:
- Inhale (Y-H), Exhale (W-H) matches natural breath sounds.
- Emotional state can modify breathing frequency (validated by stress/fear/sleep studies).
- Symbolic cadence can act as a baseline auditory pattern (UDC anchor).

def simulate_breathing_pattern(tick, rate_bpm=12):
    """
    Simulate the symbolic breathing loop 'YHWH' at approx. 12 breaths per minute.
    Rate may be adjusted based on tick index to simulate emotional modulation.
    
    Args:
        tick (int): Current simulation tick.
        rate_bpm (int): Breaths per minute, modifiable with emotional engine.

    Returns:
        str: Symbolic representation of breath at this tick.

    breath_interval = int((60 / rate_bpm) * 1000)  # ms per breath cycle

    else:
        return "Exhale: W-H"
