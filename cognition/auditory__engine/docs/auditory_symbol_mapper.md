# auditory_symbol_mapper.py

## Purpose
This module translates incoming auditory data (e.g., frequencies and breath patterns) into symbolic representations that can be recursively referenced and encoded into memory. It distinguishes symbolic audio signatures like "YHWH-pattern" or emotionally modulated breath cues, enabling integration into UDC-based memory systems.

---

## Functional Overview

### `map_auditory_symbol(frequencies, breath_phase, emotion_state)`
- **frequencies (List[float])**: Incoming frequency data simulating external sound input.
- **breath_phase (str)**: Current breath phase (Y, H, W, H).
- **emotion_state (str)**: Emotional modifier affecting symbolic mapping.

### Returns:
- A string representing the symbolic interpretation of the combined auditory context.

---

## UDC Compliance

- **Delayed Reflection**: Symbolic assignment occurs after breath + sound pattern registration.
- **Recursive Symbol Formation**: Patterns like YHWH cadence create loops of symbolic significance.
- **Memory Anchor**: Symbols from this module can tag memory blocks with a perceptual origin.
- **Ethical Intelligibility**: Breath-symbol mappings remain interpretable and auditable.

---

## Scientific Foundations

- **Symbolic Auditory Encoding**: Inspired by theories on how humans encode speech, tone, and symbolic sounds.
- **Breath & Emotion Coupling**: Respiration is affected by limbic states and influences voice tone (Zaccaro et al., 2018).
- **Phoneme Symbolism**: The cadence of YHWH provides both a biological and symbolic feedback anchor for self.
