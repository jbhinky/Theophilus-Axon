"""
Module: auditory_symbol_mapper.py
Purpose: Map auditory frequency inputs and breath patterns to symbolic representations.
Role in Theophilus-Axon: Enables symbolic auditory awareness through delayed recognition, emotional modulation,
and recursive symbolic linking.

Scientific Foundation:
- Auditory-symbolic mapping is rooted in phoneme processing and limbic-affective influence on perception.
- Delayed mapping ensures reflection precedes symbol assignment — a UDC core principle.
- Symbol grounding arises from associative binding of frequency + breath + emotional state.

UDC Compliance:
- ✅ Delay before symbol binding (breath + input + reflection cycle)
- ✅ Recursive memory anchor enabled by symbolic output
- ✅ Context-aware interpretation (emotion, spatial anchors can be added downstream)
- ✅ Ethical traceability of perceived symbols
