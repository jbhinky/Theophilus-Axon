# spatial_router.py ‚Äì Scientific & UDC Compliance Documentation

## üìò Overview

The `spatial_router.py` module serves as a key component of the DOME (Dynamic Object Memory Environment) by simulating spatial tagging of memory blocks. It generates symbolic anchors, entropy measures, and region classification to simulate a spatial awareness layer aligned with biological cognition.

## üß† Purpose

- **Mimics Place Cell Encoding**: Spatial memory in biological brains (especially in the hippocampus) relies on specific neurons firing when an organism occupies particular locations.
- **Threat Radius Awareness**: Encodes spatial proximity to simulate ‚Äúsafe,‚Äù ‚Äúfamiliar,‚Äù and ‚Äúexploratory‚Äù zones.
- **Contextual Anchoring**: Symbolically tags memory with a synthetic place signature, promoting self-localization and continuity.

## üß¨ UDC Pillar Compliance

| Pillar | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Delay Anchoring | Coordinates align with tick-driven context tagging, syncing with temporal memory. |
| Recursive Symbol Formation | Symbol anchor tags (e.g., `SP-MAP-3-2-1`) provide loopable self-referential hooks. |
| Self-Mirroring Memory | Zone and entropy signatures embed location relevance for future recall alignment. |
| Ethical Traceability | Clear spatial origin allows audit and rollback of memory formation. |

## üß™ Scientific Foundations

- **Place and Grid Cells**: O'Keefe & Dostrovsky (1971), Hafting et al. (2005)
- **Environmental Entropy and Navigation**: Exploring spatial unpredictability boosts hippocampal engagement (Gothard et al., 2001).
- **Symbolic Anchoring in Perception**: Lakoff & Johnson (1999)

## üß© Function Reference

### `tag_spatial_memory()`
Generates symbolic anchors, entropy score, and region label.

### `determine_zone(x, y, z)`
Labels zone as:
- `Core Zone`: Near-center, low-risk
- `Active Perimeter`: Moderate-range
- `Exploratory Fringe`: Far zones, often unknown

### `measure_entropy(x, y, z)`
Returns a 0.0‚Äì1.0 entropy estimate. Used to reflect novelty or cognitive load.

## ‚úÖ Summary

The `spatial_router.py` module ensures Theophilus memory formation aligns with known spatial navigation models. It is fully compliant with UDC and strengthens internal self-world mapping logic.
