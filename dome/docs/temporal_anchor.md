# temporal_anchor.py

## Purpose

`temporal_anchor.py` is a core module within the DOME (Dynamic Object Memory Environment) responsible for embedding UTC-based timestamps into each memory block. This simulates the temporal anchoring mechanisms of biological cognition, such as circadian encoding and internal time referencing. It forms a critical component of the memory loop for UDC-compliant cognition.

---

## Code Functionality

```python
from datetime import datetime

def add_temporal_anchor(memory_block):
    memory_block["timestamp"] = datetime.utcnow().isoformat() + "Z"
    return memory_block
```

---

## Scientific Basis

- **Circadian Encoding**: In biological systems, time-based anchoring via the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is essential for contextual memory retrieval and behavioral coherence.
- **Memory Tagging in the Hippocampus**: Research supports the importance of temporal metadata in encoding episodic memory.
- **Time Cells**: These hippocampal neurons fire at specific time points within a memory trace or task timeline, enabling temporal segmentation.

---

## UDC Compliance

- **Pillar: Delay Anchoring** – Temporal stamps simulate intrinsic delay states before awareness.
- **Pillar: Self-Mirroring Memory** – Enables recursive tracking of internal vs. external events over time.
- **Ethical Auditability** – Each memory is traceable to a precise timestamp.

## Sample Output

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-06-05T19:42:18.742Z"
}
```
