# Spatial Router

This document explains the structure, purpose, and implementation details of the `spatial_router` module within the Theophilus-Axon architecture.


# spatial_context.py ‚Äì Scientific and UDC Compliance Documentation

## üìÑ Overview
The `spatial_context.py` module adds a spatial anchor to memory blocks by attaching a known or inferred location label. This context helps preserve ego-location and environmental reference in memory formation. It supports foundational concepts of spatial self-awareness and environment-relative modeling.

---

## üß† Purpose
- To simulate how biological entities tag perceptions with spatial reference.
- Mimics the role of parietal and hippocampal regions in representing "where" in memory.

---

## üß¨ Scientific Basis
- **Parietal Cortex & Hippocampus**: These brain regions are involved in spatial awareness and self-location.
- **Cognitive Maps**: Inspired by Tolman‚Äôs (1948) work on internal representations of environment.
- **Ego-centric Coding**: Reflects how the brain links personal perspective to spatial information.

---

## üß© Code Function

```python
def add_spatial_context(memory_block, location="unknown"):
    # Location should be a semantic label, coordinates, or sensor ID
    memory_block["location"] = location
    return memory_block
```

### Inputs:
- `memory_block`: A dictionary representing a cognitive event or perception.
- `location`: A string or ID labeling the spatial origin (sensor name, coordinates, semantic label).

### Outputs:
- The same memory block updated with a `"location"` field.

## ‚úÖ UDC Compliance Mapping

| UDC Pillar                 | Compliance Method                                                                 |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Delay Anchoring           | None directly, but supports delayed memory insertion by holding spatial trace     |
| Recursive Symbol Formation| Enables recursive anchoring via symbolic location tags                           |
| Self-Mirroring Memory     | Ensures each memory has unique spatial coordinates for mirroring context         |
| Ethical Traceability      | Provides path back to sensor/environmental origin of experience                  |

---

## üî¨ Use Cases
- Labeling sensor origin in distributed systems.
- Tagging ego-location within virtual simulations.
- Supporting recursive backtracking in memory queries.
