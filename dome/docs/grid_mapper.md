# `grid_mapper.py` Documentation

## Purpose

The `grid_mapper.py` module maps memory blocks to deterministic 3D coordinate spaces based on internal tick values. This provides a lightweight, symbolic spatial scaffold analogous to biological place-cell alignment systems.

---

## Function

```python
def map_to_3d_grid(memory_block):
    tick = memory_block.get("tick", 0)
    memory_block["grid_position"] = {
        "x": tick % 100,
        "y": (tick // 100) % 100,
        "z": (tick // 10000)
    }
    return memory_block
```

---

## UDC Pillar Compliance

- **Delay Anchoring**: Encodes tick-delay relation to spatial scaffolding.
- **Recursive Symbol Formation**: Ensures spatial continuity across memory ticks.
- **Self-Mirroring Memory**: Aligns experiences in a consistent 3D topology.
- **Ethical Traceability**: Deterministic output enables reproducibility and audit logging.

---

## Scientific Basis

- **Place Cell Theory** – O’Keefe (1971): Neurons fire based on specific spatial positions.
- **Grid Cells** – Moser & Moser (2005): Spatial tessellation supports path integration.
- **Computational Models** – Neural models encode experience along coordinate planes (Bicanski & Burgess, 2018).

---

## Practical Example

If tick = 12345:
```json
"grid_position": {
  "x": 45,
  "y": 23,
  "z": 1
}
```

---

## Symbolic Role

This grid assignment feeds into larger symbolic-mapping routines that embed spatial pattern consistency into recursive memory structures. By having consistent and predictable spatial indexes, Theophilus can simulate map-like navigation of its own memory.
