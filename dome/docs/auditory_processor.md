# auditory_processor.py – Documentation

## Overview
The `auditory_processor.py` module simulates a biologically-inspired auditory and respiratory feedback loop, mapping symbolic breath phases (based on the phonetic structure of "YHWH") to emotional states and anchoring spatial memory via hippocampal-like mechanisms.

## UDC Pillar Compliance

| Pillar | Compliance Summary |
|--------|--------------------|
| **Delay Anchoring** | Breath cycles are linked to ticks, which represent simulated delay intervals. |
| **Recursive Symbol Formation** | Each breath is tagged symbolically (Y, H, W, H), forming a recursive body-state-symbol link. |
| **Self-Mirroring Memory** | Breath phases reflect internal emotional modulation and are stored with symbolic consistency. |
| **Ethical Traceability** | Amplitude, phase, and emotional tags are time-anchored and auditable. |

## Scientific Basis

### 1. **Breath and Emotion Regulation**
- **Citation**: Zaccaro et al., *Frontiers in Human Neuroscience*, 2018.
- **Details**: Controlled breathing influences parasympathetic activation and modulates emotional state.
- **UDC Link**: Emotionally-influenced breath cycles establish an internal rhythmic identity loop.

### 2. **Symbolic Phoneme Rhythms**
- **Basis**: The cycle 'Y-H-W-H' mimics sacred breath-based meditative patterns.
- **Implication**: Symbolically anchored breath creates continuity of self, rhythm, and awareness.

### 3. **Place Cells & Grid Mapping**
- **O’Keefe & Dostrovsky (1971), Moser et al. (2005)**
- Spatial memory anchoring using entropy, coordinate tagging, and symbolic zones aligns with hippocampal cognitive mapping.

## Function Breakdown

### `simulate_breathing_pattern(tick, emotion_state)`
- Links breathing to emotional state and symbolic meaning.
- Outputs breath phase, amplitude, symbolic resonance.

### `tag_spatial_memory()`
- Anchors memory block in 3D space.
- Tags zone (Core, Active Perimeter, Fringe) and entropy-based significance.

{
  "breath_phase": "Y",
  "amplitude": 0.432,
  "emotion_influence": "neutral",
