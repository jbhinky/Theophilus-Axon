# spatial_context.py

"""
Adds a symbolic or sensor-derived spatial label to the memory block for context-aware
processing. This provides localized anchoring within the memory framework and supports
symbolic association across environments.

SCIENTIFIC BASIS:
- Contextual anchoring is critical for episodic memory in biological systems. The hippocampus
  encodes not only spatial geometry but also **contextual labels** from environments (Smith & Mizumori, 2006).
- Semantic labeling of space (e.g., "sensor-A", "lab", "home") contributes to **predictive modeling**
  and recognition tasks in the brain, often tied to medial temporal lobe structures.

UDC COMPLIANCE:
✔ Complies with the UDC Principle of Recursive Environment Mapping.
✔ Contributes to delayed symbolic grounding by creating retrievable location-linked associations.
✔ Supports ethical memory traceability and reinforces context integrity during recall.
