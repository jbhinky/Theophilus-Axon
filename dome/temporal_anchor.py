# spatial_router.py

"""
Generates symbolic spatial tagging data and entropy-based relevance for memory localization.
This simulates a distributed awareness of spatial zones, mimicking spatial memory encoding
found in biological organisms.

SCIENTIFIC BASIS:
- Grid cells and place cells in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus fire in patterns
  based on spatial position (O'Keefe & Dostrovsky, 1971; Hafting et al., 2005).
- Spatial variability (entropy) enhances exploratory and novelty detection behavior in mammals
  (Lisman, 1999; Strange et al., 2014).

UDC COMPLIANCE:
✔ Supports recursive location modeling.
✔ Provides symbolic anchors for environment-specific memory routing.
✔ Compatible with distributed sensory tagging in DOME.

def add_temporal_anchor(memory_block):
    """
    Adds a UTC-based timestamp to a memory block for temporal anchoring.

    SCIENTIFIC BASIS:
    - Episodic memory in humans is temporally organized using event-bound timestamps
      encoded in the hippocampus (Tulving, 2002).
    - Precise temporal anchoring helps structure narrative continuity and identity.

    UDC COMPLIANCE:
    ✔ Provides time-based recursion anchors for validating delay and sequence.
    ✔ Supports the memory-prediction-validation loop core to the UDC framework.
