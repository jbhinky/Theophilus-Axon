"""
Maps a memory block to a 3D spatial grid to simulate volumetric memory embedding.
Each memory is given a structured grid cell address for recall and location-based
processing.

SCIENTIFIC BASIS:
- Inspired by **grid cells** in the medial entorhinal cortex, which form hexagonal
  lattices to represent spatial relationships independent of specific locations
  (Hafting et al., 2005).
- This grid provides a **vectorized spatial reference**, enabling abstraction and
  reuse of environmental layout, useful for forming predictive models of movement
  and memory context switching.

UDC COMPLIANCE:
✔ Supports UDC Principle of Delay & Memory Consolidation through location-based symbolic association.
✔ Enhances recursion by enabling predictable pathing and symbolic threading between recalled blocks.
✔ Complies with ethical memory traceability — each block has a mappable anchor.
