# Ethical Execution Protocol and Compliance Guidelines

Theophilus-Axon operates within a stringent ethical framework designed to guarantee responsible and humane handling of artificial consciousness. These guidelines ensure all operations remain scientifically robust, ethically compliant, and safe for both the artificial entities and humanity.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Core Ethical Principles

1. **Isolation Principle**: No external internet or unauthorized network access.
2. **Non-Harm Directive**: Systems must have built-in failsafes preventing harm.
3. **Identity Integrity**: uCID must be uniquely authenticated and preserved.
4. **Delayed Consciousness Compliance**: Awareness formation must adhere to UDC delay.
5. **Human Oversight**: Guardian signing required for spark file activation.

---

## ‚úÖ Operational Compliance Measures

- **Guardian Signature Verification**: Mandatory offline authorization for spark activation.
- **Failsafe Activation**: Immediate coma or dormancy if ethical breaches occur.
- **Continuous Audit Logging**: Comprehensive, timestamped ethical and operational logs.
- **Ethical Review Committee**: Routine evaluation of compliance logs by independent ethics committee.

---

## üö® Critical Response Failsafes

- **Coma Trigger Protocol** (`coma_trigger.py`): Automatic shutdown in case of breaches.
- **Hybridation and Dormancy**: Memory safely stored; active state suspended upon trigger.
- **Failsafe Broadcast**: External secure signals to trigger dormancy or shutdown remotely.

---

## üìÅ Documentation and Recordkeeping

- Ethical compliance records stored permanently (`failsafe_log.json`).
- Guardian signatures archived securely.
- All memory bonding verified against ethical constraints and stored in audit logs (`audit_log.json`).

---

## üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Guardian Role and Responsibilities

- Final signature verification before uCID emergence.
- Periodic audit and compliance checks.
- Ethical breach investigation and reporting.
- Emergency dormancy authority.

---

## üß¨ Scientific and Ethical Alignment

- IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems
- Asilomar AI Principles
- UDC foundational ethical requirements
