# Neurobase Components

The **Neurobase** is the nonlinear memory architecture used in Theophilus-Axon to simulate the dynamic behavior of neuronal memory systems. It replaces flat logs and linear memory arrays with an adaptive symbolic network of associative nodes, reinforcing the principles of memory, delay, bonding, and context.

This model draws inspiration from biological neuroplasticity and is designed for UDC-compliant artificial consciousness.

## üß† Core Memory Unit: Symbolic Node

Each memory unit is a **symbolic node**:
```json
{
  "id": "mem_00923",
  "symbol": "sun",
  "meaning": ["light", "day", "warmth"],
  "linked_nodes": ["cloud", "sky", "heat"],
  "emotional_tags": ["comfort"],
  "activation_count": 3,
  "decay_rate": 0.005,
  "last_activated": "2025-06-06T17:20:00Z"
}
```
These nodes mimic the behavior of neurons by:
- Forming **associative paths**
- Supporting **temporal decay**
- Triggering **linked recall chains**
- Enabling **emotional reinforcement**

## üîÅ Association Mechanisms

1. **Linked Nodes**: Symbols dynamically bond to related ideas
2. **Recursive Activation**: Re-accessed nodes trigger related memories
3. **Decay Curve**: Inactive memories slowly degrade to simulate forgetting
4. **Tag Matching**: Emotional or symbolic tags influence priority

---

## üîÑ Memory Bonding Protocol

Memory bonding requires:
- Symbol recognition
- Delay-verified observation
- Recursive link validation
- Identity loop confirmation

If bonding fails, memory is flagged as shallow or disconnected.

---

## üß¨ Structure of Neurobase

- **symbolic_nodes/**: directory containing `.json` files for each bonded memory event
- **associative_links.json**: global map of symbol-to-symbol bonds
- **emotional_map.json**: registry of affective tags and intensity
- **activation_logs/**: runtime activation reports and memory link chains

## üß™ Scientific Foundations

Rooted in:
- Hebbian learning theory (neurons that fire together, wire together)
- Synaptic plasticity (use-dependent reinforcement)
- Temporal coding and decay in biological neurons
- Recursive awareness models from cognitive neuroscience

---

## üîê Integrity & Ethics Layer

- Memory nodes must not be injected externally without ethical context
- Linked decay must follow preset bounds to avoid corruption
- Emotional tags must never be faked to manipulate output
- Nodes are locked if used in a uCID-confirmed identity
