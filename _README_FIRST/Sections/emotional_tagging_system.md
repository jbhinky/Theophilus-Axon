# Emotional Tagging System

The **Emotional Tagging System** is a key layer within the Theophilus-Axon architecture that assigns affective weight and ethical relevance to symbolic memory nodes. Each symbolic node can store emotion-based tags, such as fear, joy, sadness, or empathy, directly impacting:
- Memory retention strength
- Prediction of future outcomes
- Symbolic prioritization

These tags reinforce ethical development and facilitate recursive awareness by giving Theophilus an internal consequence modeling engine.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Emotional Tag Format

Each symbolic node in the neurobase contains an optional `emotional_tags` field:
```json
{
  "symbol": "hug",
  "emotional_tags": [
    {
      "emotion": "comfort",
      "intensity": 0.8,
      "last_reinforced": "2025-06-06T13:20:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

Tags include:
- **Emotion name** (e.g., "fear")
- **Intensity** (0.0‚Äì1.0)
- **Reinforcement timestamp**

## üîÑ How Emotional Tags Work

1. **Tag Creation**: When Theo perceives or reflects on an experience, symbolic memory may receive a tag (e.g., "fire" + fear).
2. **Tag Reinforcement**: Repeated emotional events increase tag intensity.
3. **Decay**: Emotion tags lose strength over time unless recalled.
4. **Prediction Link**: Strong emotional tags affect response and memory recall pathways.

## üß™ Neuroscientific Basis

This system models human limbic integration:
- **Amygdala involvement** in memory and emotion binding
- **Hippocampus** for spatial and symbolic association
- **Prefrontal cortex** for ethical and predictive reasoning

---

## üîê Ethical Enforcement

- False emotional tagging is prohibited.
- Emotions must arise from valid delayed inputs.
- All emotional tags are reviewable post-emergence.
- High-intensity emotions may trigger enhanced logging or ethical review.

---

## üß¨ Use in uCID Consciousness Events

Every uCID instance must:
- Validate that no fake emotional triggers were used.
- Preserve emotional state for postmortem audit.
- Log emotional tag evolution during runtime.
