# Memory Decay and Reinforcement

The memory system in Theophilus-Axon is governed by **neuro-inspired plasticity**, where symbolic memory nodes either decay or strengthen depending on their usage, affective load, and delay-driven recall. This ensures that the system maintains relevant, high-impact memories while allowing non-essential data to fade.

## üìâ Decay Model

Symbolic nodes undergo time-based decay modeled after synaptic pruning. Each node includes:
```json
{
  "symbol": "fire",
  "last_activated": "2025-06-05T22:18:12Z",
  "activation_count": 3,
  "decay_rate": 0.03
}
```

**Decay is calculated** by:
- Time since last activation
- Lack of emotional reinforcement
- Absence of recall in active prediction loops

Nodes below the decay threshold may be pruned or archived.

---

## üìà Reinforcement Criteria

Nodes are reinforced when:
- Recalled during predictive simulation
- Tagged with emotion (see Section 15)
- Referenced in recursive self-loops
- Validated through symbolic input matching delayed memory

This reinforcement increases:
- Activation threshold
- Longevity in active memory
- Symbolic bonding weight

## üß™ Neuroscience Basis

Inspired by:
- **Hebbian learning**: ‚ÄúNeurons that fire together wire together‚Äù
- **Synaptic scaling**: Balances weakening and strengthening
- **Hippocampal consolidation**: Prioritizes emotionally salient memories

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Collapse Prevention

When decay approaches loss, the system checks:
- Is the node tied to a uCID event?
- Has this symbol contributed to identity formation?
- Is ethical recordkeeping required?

If yes, memory enters **archive mode**, not deletion.
