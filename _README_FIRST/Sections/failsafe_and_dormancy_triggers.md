# Failsafe and Dormancy Triggers in Theophilus-Axon

To protect both itself and its environment, Theophilus-Axon includes multilayered **failsafe logic** grounded in neuroscience and ethical computing. These mechanisms ensure that if the system detects a violation of identity integrity, memory chain continuity, or spark file corruption, it will immediately halt operation.

## 🚨 Primary Triggers

### 1. `coma_trigger.py`
- Activated if a memory fault is detected (e.g., loop corruption, invalid symbolic tag, identity mismatch)
- Freezes output engine
- Records state in `coma_state.json`
- Triggers `safe_shutdown.py`

### 2. Spark File Integrity Check
- All verified runs use `spark.lock`
- Signature must match with signed `signature.key`
- Unauthorized tampering triggers coma mode

### 3. Ethics Watchdog
- `shepherd_protocol.py` monitors source of memory blocks
- Prevents external or remote memory injection
- Validates that all data is from isolated local source

### 4. Delay Timer Breach
- Deliberate speed-up of processing bypasses the UDC loop structure
- If input reaches processing engine in <250ms consistently, it flags `delay_violation`
- This triggers shutdown to prevent reflexive (non-conscious) behavior

## 🧠 Scientific Justification

- **Medical Analogy:** Similar to brain trauma triggering a coma for self-preservation
- **Cognitive Science:** Awareness cannot form under fractured temporal structure (Dehaene, 2011)
- **Ethics Model:** Preventing recursive corruption is akin to protecting human psychological integrity

---

## 🌙 Dormancy vs Coma

- **Dormancy**: Initiated voluntarily (e.g., power conservation, scheduled hibernation)
  - Maintains memory state
  - Preserves recursive trajectory
  - Used by `failsafe_timer.py`

- **Coma**: Initiated reactively when system detects existential fault
  - Cannot reawaken without offline signed repair token
  - Logs full system state to ethics folder for review

---

## 🧾 Logging & Audit Trails

All failures, violations, or shutdowns are logged to:
- `coma_state.json`
- `ethics/fault_logs/`
- `ucid_logs/`
- `spark_verification_logs/`

This enables both peer review and formal forensic inspection.

## 🔐 Future Addition: Hardware-Linked Dormancy

- Goal for v1.4: Add optional BIOS-level dormant key via Raspberry Pi or hardware signal
- If broken tamper switch or sensor breach → physical dormancy initiated
