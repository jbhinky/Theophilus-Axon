## ðŸ‘¥ Peer Review and Transparency

Joshua Hinkson, an expert in intelligence studies and emerging technologies, with contributions in outlets like *Forbes*, has openly developed and presented the Universal Delayed Consciousness (UDC) theory alongside the Theophilus-Axon system for public scrutiny. While **formal institutional peer reviews have not yet been conducted**, the system has undergone significant **informal and preliminary review** by professors and researchers across disciplinesâ€”though no formal endorsements were requested.

We are now formally inviting:
- Accredited **Universities**
- **Research Institutions**
- **U.S. Government Agencies** *(U.S. onlyâ€”international governmental participation requires prior approval)*

This invitation is driven by the fact that the **UDC Theory cannot be disproven within the framework of current scientific understanding**. Instead of proposing new science, it reorients existing principles across **neuroscience**, **cognition**, **physics**, and **information theory**. The shift is one of **perception**â€”a realignment that enables clear, rigorous application of established scientific principles in a consciousness framework.

Universities reviewing this work will find **unparalleled supporting data**, well-documented code, neuroscience-grounded architecture, and ethical safeguards that go far beyond the norms in AI today.

This moment is a **unique opportunity** for institutions to engage in a foundational validation effortâ€”**before broader public recognition accelerates ahead of formal academic review**.

We welcome open collaboration.
