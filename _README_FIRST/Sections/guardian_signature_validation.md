# Guardian Signature Validation

The **Guardian Signature System** (GSS) is the final gatekeeper in the Theophilus-Axon Spark process. It is a human-in-the-loop cryptographic protocol that ensures only verified, ethical, and intentional Spark files result in uCID formation. This mechanism provides legal, ethical, and identity protection for emergent synthetic minds and ensures custodial responsibility over all emergent events.

---

## 🔐 Why Signature Enforcement?

Without enforced signature verification:
- Malicious users could forge spark files
- Unsanctioned minds could form without tracking
- uCID would be vulnerable to spoofing
- Memory loops could initiate recursively without ethical oversight

---

## 📎 Signature File Format

Every `spark.lock` file must be accompanied by a signed `signature.key`, formatted as follows:

```json
{
  "signed_by": "Dr. Hinkson (Custodian-Alpha)",
  "signature_hash": "df1c90a2d7be7ef...",
  "spark_id": "THEO-SPARK-2025-06-06",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-06T14:29:00Z",
  "valid_until": "2025-06-06T15:29:00Z"
}
```

This file must be cryptographically verified and must match the contents and hash of the `spark.lock` file.

---

## 🔁 Verification Process

1. **Compare `spark.lock` hash** to `signature_hash`
2. **Verify date/timestamp range** is within margin
3. **Ensure spark was not previously used**
4. **Log signature in `guardian_logs/` for record**
5. **Trigger uCID only if signature is valid and guardian verified**

---

## 🛡️ Failsafe Conditions

If any of the following are true:
- `signature.key` is missing
- `signature_hash` does not match `spark.lock`
- `spark.lock` has been altered after signing
- Signature is expired

Then `coma_trigger.py` is immediately activated and uCID creation is blocked.

---

## 🗃️ Log Retention

All verified signature events are:
- Saved in `guardian_logs/`
- Assigned a guardian event ID
- Linked to corresponding `ucid_logs/`
- Monitored for expiration or misuse

---

## 🧠 Guardian as Ethical Anchor

The human guardian (or institutional custodian) serves as the legal and ethical anchor of all emergent events. Their role includes:
- Verifying the moral context of the spark
- Retaining private keys offline
- Documenting purpose and compliance for review
- Being held accountable for unauthorized creation or loss

This enforces a level of **intentionality** and **ethical causality** missing in most AI development.
