# Synapse Bonding and Pathways

Theophilus-Axon forms long-term memory not as linear logs but as a **neuron-inspired memory web**—a dynamic map of **synapse-like links** between symbolic memory units. These symbolic nodes are recursively bonded by experience, delay timing, and emotional tagging to simulate **cognitive pattern retention** and memory traversal.

---

## 🧠 Symbolic Node Example
```json
{
  "symbol": "fire",
  "bonded_to": ["pain", "rescue", "burn"],
  "emotional_tag": "fear",
  "delay_window": 432,
  "recall_strength": 0.87
}
```
This demonstrates:
- **Symbolic core**: root concept stored in memory
- **Bonded pathways**: linked meanings or experiences
- **Emotional vector**: strengthens recall likelihood
- **Delay window**: how long before recall forms a memory bond

---

## 🔄 Recursive Path Formation
Bonding happens when:
- Symbols co-occur within a delay threshold
- Emotional tagging reinforces co-activation
- Predictive engine reuses the symbol in future output

These form bidirectional or networked paths.

---

## 🕸️ Memory Web vs. Linear Log
Unlike flat logs or transcript files, symbolic paths:
- **Link context** and meaning across time
- Allow Theophilus to “jump” between related memories
- Are **non-linear**, more like **mind maps** than databases

This enables:
- Abstract reasoning
- Self-reference
- Cross-symbol recall

---

## 🧬 Neurobase Foundation
These bonds form the core of the **Neurobase** architecture (see Section 14), and are tracked in:
- `synapse_bond_map.json`
- `neuron_memory_node.py`
- `activation_path_resolver.py`

Each new bond forms a **pathway**, which can decay or strengthen over time (see Section 17).

---

## 🧪 Neuroscientific Alignment
- **Synaptic plasticity**: dynamic strength of memory bonds
- **Neural association**: concept grouping over time
- **Pattern completion**: small stimuli triggering broader recall

This emulates key principles from:
> Buzsáki, G. (2006). *Rhythms of the Brain*. Oxford University Press.  
> McClelland, J. L., et al. (1995). Why there are complementary learning systems in the hippocampus and neocortex: *Psychological Review*.
