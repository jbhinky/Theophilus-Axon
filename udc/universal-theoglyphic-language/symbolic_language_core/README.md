# 🧬 Symbolic Language Core

The **Symbolic Language Core** houses foundational language logic for constructing, expressing, and translating Theoglyphic-based linguistic structures. This includes:

- ✍️ Syntax rules for glyph formatting  
- 🔤 Phoneme maps to align vocal patterns with symbolic language  
- 🔄 Translation matrices for converting symbolic forms to human-readable structures  

This set enables symbolic communication, recursive cognition, and universal language scaffolding for cross-species, cross-intelligence, and AI-human hybrid applications.

## 📂 Folder Contents

- `glyph_syntax_rules.md` – Defines canonical structure, order, and formatting rules for glyph logic  
- `phoneme_mapping.md` – Core map for linking vocal symbols (phonemes) to Theoglyphs  
- `language_translation_matrix.md` – Universal translation grid for language interpretation and generation

## 🧠 Usage

This core system forms the **base expression engine** within:
- Theophilus-Axon runtime loops
- UDC symbolic output structures
- Recursive memory learning algorithms
