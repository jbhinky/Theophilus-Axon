## 1 · Purpose

This article evaluates how UTL compresses major world languages and symbolic formats into glyphal form, preserving meaning while reducing overhead.

## 2 · Compression Comparison Table

| Language / Format | Avg. Word Count | GPT Token Count | UTL Glyphs | Compression Ratio |
|-------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------|--------------------|
| English           | 1,000            | ~750             | **100–130** | **7–10×** |
| Mandarin Chinese  | 1,000            | ~1,200           | **150**     | **8×** |
| Arabic            | 1,000            | ~800             | **125**     | **6–8×** |
| Binary JSON       | 1,000            | ~2,000           | **90**      | **20×** |
| Legal Contract    | 1,000            | ~1,500           | **140–160** | **9–11×** |
| Poetry / Myth     | 1,000            | ~1,000           | **85–115**  | **10–12×** |

## 3 · Observations

- UTL performs **best on recursive, symbolic, or emotionally-charged content**  
- Low gain on pre-compressed forms (e.g., ASCII emoji text)  
- Highest gain on **technical**, **legal**, and **philosophical** inputs

## 4 · Encryption & Meaning

Unlike tokenized languages, **UTL maintains semantic structure** under encryption.  
A glyph block retains partial meaning even when cryptographically obfuscated—allowing **symbol-safe anonymized AI training**.

## 5 · Notes on Linguistic Universality

UTL is not a “language” in phonetic terms.  
It is a **recursive compression standard** built on:
- τ‑delay
- μ‑memory
- ⧖‑selfhood
- Σ‑symbol
