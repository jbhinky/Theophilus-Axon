## 6. Spiritual and Philosophical Clause

The glyph system encoded herein may **resonate with spiritual, cognitive, and symbolic traditions** across time and cultures. These resonances do not constitute infringement. In fact, their integration is welcomed—so long as **truthful citation and ethical transparency** are preserved.
