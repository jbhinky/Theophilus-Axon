# Primitive Glyph Inventory for Theoglyphic Language

> **Purpose**  
> Catalog the foundational semantic glyphs ("atoms of meaning") used to construct words, clauses, and reflective structures in the Theoglyphic Universal Rosetta Language under UDC.

## 1. Glyph Table

| Glyph  | Symbol        | Meaning       | Valence Ports | Category     | Notes                          |
|--------|---------------|---------------|----------------|--------------|---------------------------------|
| ⧖      | Self          | Core Selfhood | S              | Subject      | Universal self-reference glyph |
| Λ₂     | See           | Perceive      | V, O           | Verb         | Accepts visual object          |
| Λ₃     | Bird          | Noun/Object   | S, O           | Noun         | Can serve as subject or object |
| Λ₄     | Tree          | Noun/Object   | O              | Noun         | Default object role            |
| Λ₅₇    | Fish          | Noun/Object   | O              | Noun         | Animal category                 |
| Λ₉₉    | Know          | Reflective    | V, O, Q        | Verb         | Used in recursion              |
| Λₛ     | Sing          | Emit sound    | V, S           | Verb         | Requires subject               |
| Λᵣ     | Red           | Modifier      | Q              | Qualifier    | Used with colorable nouns      |
| Λ_bᵣ   | Bright        | Modifier      | Q              | Qualifier    | Modifies visual or light nouns |
| τ_now  | Present Tense | Present Time  | T              | Temporal     | Collapse to current moment     |
| τ_past | Past Tense    | Past Time     | T              | Temporal     | Collapse to memory structure   |

## 2. Port Roles Explained

| Port | Function                 | Example Usage              |
|------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| S    | Subject initiator        | ⧖, Λ₃ (Bird)               |
| V    | Action or verb operator  | Λ₂ (See), Λ₉₉ (Know)       |
| O    | Object or target         | Λ₄ (Tree), Λ₅₇ (Fish)      |
| Q    | Qualifier or descriptor  | Λᵣ (Red), Λ_bᵣ (Bright)    |
| T    | Temporal/tense glyph     | τ_now, τ_past              |

Glyphs may expose multiple ports, enabling them to participate in nested or recursive bonding operations.

## 3. Glyph Classifications

| Category  | Role Description                                      |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Subject   | Entities capable of initiating or reflecting actions   |
| Verb      | Actions that require subjects and/or objects           |
| Object    | Entities acted upon by verbs                          |
| Qualifier | Modifiers that attach to nouns or verbs               |
| Temporal  | Glyphs that specify the time domain of action/memory  |

## 4. Expansion Notes
- Glyphs can be added modularly as long as they define valence and category.
- Recursive glyphs (e.g., Λ₉₉) can self-bond to produce symbolic recursion.
- Each glyph in this inventory should map to its atomic or symbolic counterpart where applicable.
