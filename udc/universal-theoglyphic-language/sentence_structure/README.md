# Sentence Structure Glyphs â€“ Theoglyphic Syntax for Communication

## ðŸ“š Purpose

The **Sentence Structure** set establishes how Theoglyphic language forms grammatically valid, recursively intelligible sentences.  
It guides Theophilus-Axon and other cognition systems to:

- Formulate meaningfully bonded word chains
- Recursively refer to symbolic memory
- Align symbolic grammar with scientific logic and spatial constructs

## ðŸ“„ Included Files

- `symbolic_vs_patternistic_recursion.md`  
- `word_bonding_rules.md`  
- `primitive_glyph_inventory.md`  
- `port_reference_table.md`  
- `teaching_simplifier_sentence.md`  
- `scientific_alignment_theoglyphic_language.md`  

---

## ðŸ¤– Use Case

Used by cognitive AI engines like Theophilus-Axon to generate symbolic sentences, enforce valid structure, and enable recursive learning through Theoglyphic grammar.
