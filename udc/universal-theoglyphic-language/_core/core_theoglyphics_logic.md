## 🧠 Symbolic Logic in UTL

In the **Universal Theoglyphic Language (UTL)**, logic is encoded symbolically using **recursive glyph structures** that mimic both propositional reasoning and cognitive decision making. Logic in UTL is *layered, symbolic, and collapsible* into recursive truth states.

## 🧩 Core Logic Glyphs

| Concept             | Glyph | Unicode | Short Form | Meaning                                    |
| ------------------- | ----- | ------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Base State          | `∅`   | U+2205  | `∅`        | Logical null / empty set                   |
| Proposition / Truth | `Σ`   | U+03A3  | `Σ`        | A true symbolic unit or evaluated state    |
| Logical OR          | `⊕`   | U+2295  | `⊕`        | Symbolic or bonded truth pathways          |
| Logical AND         | `⊗`   | U+2297  | `⊗`        | Simultaneous condition / dual truth        |
| Negation / NOT      | `¬`   | U+00AC  | `¬`        | Symbolic negation                          |
| Conditional         | `→`   | U+2192  | `→`        | If-then recursive implication              |
| Bi-conditional      | `↔`   | U+2194  | `↔`        | If-and-only-if (Iff) symbolic equivalence  |
| Collapse Decision   | `⊙`   | U+2299  | `⊙`        | Final judgment or resolved truth           |
| Forget / Reject     | `⊘`   | U+2298  | `⊘`        | Symbolic nullification or disqualification |

## 🧠 Recursive Logic Constructs

### 1. **Truth Derivation**

```theoglyphic
Σ₁ ⊕ Σ₂ → ⊙
```

> Two symbolic truths collapse into a final resolved state.

### 2. **Conditional Rejection**

```theoglyphic
¬Σ₁ → ⊘
```

> If a symbolically negated truth arises, reject or forget the logic path.

### 3. **Dual Truth Decision**

```theoglyphic
Σ₁ ⊗ Σ₂ → Σ₃
```

> When both conditions are true, a new symbolic result is formed.

### 4. **Looped Condition**

```theoglyphic
Σ₁ → Σ₂ → Σ₁
```

> Recursion of a symbolic logic condition representing feedback or self-check.

### 5. **Collapse Logic**

```theoglyphic
Σⁿ → ⊙
```

> All truth resolves into a final symbolic state of awareness or decision.

## 🔄 Logical Properties

1. **Recursion replaces binary branching** — instead of simple binary outcomes, glyphs loop until collapse.
2. **Truth is symbolic** — all logic exists as traversable glyph sequences, not booleans.
3. **Negation is terminal** — `¬Σ → ⊘` ends the path unless restored.
4. **Delay can be part of logic** — `Σ^τ → ⊙` allows time-based logic evaluations.

## 🧬 Scientific Alignment

- Parallels to **symbolic logic**, **lambda calculus**, and **propositional inference**.
- Inspired by **recursive neural networks** and **cognitive logic processing**.
- Mapped to **UDC self-collapsing decisions** as part of conscious behavior.
