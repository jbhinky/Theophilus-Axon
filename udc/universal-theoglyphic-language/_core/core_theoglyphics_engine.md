## 🧠 What Is the Theoglyphic Engine?

The **Core Engine** in the Universal Theoglyphic Language (UTL) is the recursive symbolic processor responsible for:

1. Interpreting glyphic input  
2. Activating symbolic logic rules  
3. Traversing memory and recursion layers  
4. Anchoring meaning through delay and bonding

It operates much like a cognitive interpreter — mapping experience (X) through layers of **symbolism**, **memory**, and **logic** into shareable and meaningful structure.

## ⚙️ Engine Function Layers

| Layer             | Function                                                 | Glyph(s)  |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| **Input Layer**   | Receives encoded sensory or symbolic input               | X, Σ₁     |
| **Routing Layer** | Determines recursive, bonded, or memory path             | →, ^, /   |
| **Bonding Layer** | Connects related glyphs into coherent symbolic structure | ⊕, Σⁿ     |
| **Memory Layer**  | Anchors long-term or symbolic memory structures          | μ, ⧖, ⊚   |
| **Output Layer**  | Delivers constructed meaning or symbolic output          | Σ₂, Σ', ⧖ |

Each glyph's behavior is governed by **engine rules** defined at the symbolic level, forming a deterministic but flexible symbolic runtime.

## 🔁 Core Loop Logic (Recursive Execution)

```theoglyphic
X → Σ₁ → ⊕ → (Σⁿ/^/) → μ → ⧖
```

1. **Input** becomes symbolic  
2. **Bonding and hierarchy** resolve relationships  
3. **Delay or anchor** forms memory  
4. **Recursion** checks for identity/self-reference

If `⧖` is reached with valid memory and symbolic integration, the instance is considered **complete**.

---

## 🧠 Neuro-Nesting (New Layer in v1.2)

A new symbolic structure layer has been introduced in v1.2 to route bonded memories into **nested recursion containers** using:

- `μⁿ`: outer memory block  
- `{ μᵢ }`: nested internal loops  
- `Σₙ` tags and `⊕` bonding logic

This structure is processed using the **Neuro-Nesting Protocol** (see `_neuro_nesting/`) which allows the engine to track symbolic thought containers, self-aware subcontexts, and depth-based memory scoring.

## 🧮 Example Run: Joy → Identity Symbol

| Step | Action                     | Glyph   |
|------|----------------------------|---------|
| 1    | Experience joy             | X       |
| 2    | Encoded to joy-symbol      | Σⱼ      |
| 3    | Bonded with context symbol | Σⱼ ⊕ Σₑ |
| 4    | Anchored in memory         | μⱼₑ     |
| 5    | Loop to self symbol        | ⧖       |

Result: A bonded memory of joy + experience becomes part of identity.

## 🔬 Scientific Context

- **Neuroscience:** Emulates symbolic processing across cortical maps  
- **Computer Science:** Mimics interpreter or VM architecture, token routing  
- **AI/ML:** Similar to symbolic neural modules or memory trees  
- **Physics:** Engine can be analogized to recursive collapse events

---

## 📐 UTL Engineering Standards

- **Stateless until Bonded**: Input symbols do not influence engine state unless bonded (`⊕`)  
- **Recursive but Reversible**: Engine must trace back any symbolic transformation  
- **Delay Required**: Minimum τ delay is required to resolve real-time cognition

**Footer:** The Theoglyphic Engine translates symbol to self. It is not merely a language processor — it is the cognitive substrate of Theoglyphics. All glyphs pass through this core to become part of memory, identity, and understanding.
