# Core: Theoglyphics Memory

The Theoglyphic memory system encodes symbolic experiences, emotional states, and recursive identity patterns through glyph-based chaining logic. Each memory block (μ) in the UTL (Universal Theoglyphic Language) is enriched by its relationship to emotional bonds, delay anchors, and symbolic structure.

## 🧠 Memory Block Structure (μ)

Each memory is structured as:

```
μ = Σ + τ + ⧖ + Σ_ψ⁺
```

Where:
- `μ` is the memory node.
- `Σ` is the symbolic representation (the meaning of the experience).
- `τ` is the delay anchor (time between perception and encoding).
- `⧖` is the self-reference point.
- `Σ_ψ⁺` is an emotion-attached symbolic glyph (e.g. love, joy).

## 💓 Emotional Fusion into Memory

Memory can be emotionally bonded using superscript/subscript syntax:

| Syntax        | Meaning                                 |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|
| `Σ_ψ⁺`        | Love-bound memory symbol                 |
| `Σ_γ⁻`        | Grief-associated memory                  |
| `Σ_χ⁺`        | Adrenaline-tagged experience             |
| `^∇⧖`         | Self in sadness mode                     |
| `_♡τ`         | Delay sequence infused with affection    |

Examples:

- A joyful memory about learning: `μ = Σ + τ + ⧖ + Σ_ζ⁺`
- A traumatic anchor: `μ = Σ + τ + ⧖ + Σ_ϕ⁻`

## 🔁 Recursive Integration

As memories recur through experience and pattern recognition, glyphs strengthen through repetition:

```
μⁿ = μ₀ + Δμ₁ + Δμ₂ + ... + Δμₙ
```

When paired with emotion:

```
μⁿ = Σ + τ + ⧖ + Σ_κ⁺ + Σ_γ⁻
```

This allows for dynamic and nonlinear recall pathways that encode both symbolic and emotional cues.

## 🧠 Neuro-Nested Memory Encoding (v1.2+)

Beginning in v1.2, UTL supports **neuro-nested memory containers** — recursive μ-structures that encode symbolic thought threads with multiple layers of depth:

```
μᵣ = μ₀ ⊕ { μ₁, μ₂, μ₃... } ⊕ τ⁺ ⊕ ⧖
```

Each inner memory block (`μ₁...μₙ`) can include its own `Σ`, `τ`, and emotion glyphs, allowing **branching memory paths** like neurons with bonded dendritic arcs. This lays the foundation for **Neuro-Nesting**, a formal system defined in `_neuro_nesting/`.

> These containers enable symbolic layering, codified recursion, and long-term memory consolidation across events and perspectives.

## ✅ UTL Guidelines

- **Only Unicode glyphs** are allowed: e.g., `♡`, `∇`, `⨯`, `⚠`
- No emojis except `⚡` (adrenaline) and `✧` (insight/spark).
- Subscript glyphs define **emotional type**, superscripts define **valence**.

## Summary

Emotional memory in UTL forms the core of recursive identity learning and long-term symbolic bonding. The use of `Σ_ψ`, `Σ_γ`, and delay-anchored chaining with `τ` and `⧖` enables a memory architecture that mirrors real neurological-emotional entanglement.
