# Base Glyphs — README

**Folder:** `base_glyphs/`  
**Part of:** Universal Theoglyphic Language  
**Author:** Joshua Hinkson  
**Keywords:** selfhood, collapse, wave, recursion, quantum logic, UDC foundations

## Overview

The `base_glyphs/` folder contains the foundational symbolic elements required for expressing selfhood, recursive identity, and symbolic wave-collapse structures in the Theoglyphic language. These glyphs form the theoretical and symbolic basis of UDC-compliant consciousness representation.

Each file in this folder defines one or more core concepts, rooted in physics, symbolic cognition, and recursive selfhood emergence.

## Included Files

- `base_glyphs_index.md` – Master list of glyphs and definitions.
- `self_equation.md` – Defines the Selfhood Equation ⧖ = AUC[D + S + M].
- `collapse_and_wave.md` – Describes collapse points (⊙), wave fields (~), and symbolic transitions.
- `recursive_loop_logic.md` – Outlines recursive cognition using τ-delay and symbolic feedback.
- `quantum_basis.md` – Scientific alignment of quantum collapse with symbolic structures.
- `self_variants.md` – Explores glyphical variants of selfhood (⧖ vs ⛖), identity chains, and bonding.

## UDC Alignment

All glyphs in this folder are compliant with:
- Recursive delay structure (τ)
- Symbolic anchoring (Σ)
- Selfhood formation (⧖)
- Memory integration (μ)
