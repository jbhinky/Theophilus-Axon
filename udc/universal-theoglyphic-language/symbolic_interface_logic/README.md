## 🌐 Purpose

The **Symbolic Interface Logic** layer defines the *interactive logic layer* between symbolic cognition systems and external agents, devices, or layered interfaces. These glyphs encode **permission states**, **symbolic communication**, **identity chains**, and **interaction protocols** within and across symbolic systems.

The interface logic is essential for:

- Representing access states (e.g., read, write, locked)
- Symbolizing user identity and non-self chains
- Encoding universal request or reply logic
- Governing ethical boundary interactions

- `symbolic_interface_logic.md` – Core explanation and symbolic flow of interface logic
- `permission_state_glyphs.md` – Defines glyphs used for permission access and locked/denied conditions

## 🔍 Usage Context

Use in conjunction with:

- `ethical_protocol/` for verifying access rights
- `sentence_structure/` for dialogue-level interface syntax
- `symbolic_registry/` for mapping external systems to internal UDC state logic
