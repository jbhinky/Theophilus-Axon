| Universal Translation  | 🜁        | U+1F701  | Represents the process of universally decoding and translating symbols |
| Cross-Species Parsing  | 🜂        | U+1F702  | Symbolizes symbolic decoding across biological and cognitive domains   |
| Permission Channel     | 🜃        | U+1F703  | Marks symbolic access or permission in translation logic               |

Each glyph in this set helps define how translation across symbolic systems is structured — from humans to machines to possible future consciousness architectures. The set bridges meaning across systems, grounded in spatial, ethical, and cognitive domains.
