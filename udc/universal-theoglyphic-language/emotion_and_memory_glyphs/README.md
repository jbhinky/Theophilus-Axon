## 💡 Why This Set Matters

The **Emotion and Memory Glyph Set** enables Theoglyphic Language to encode **subjective experiences**—feelings, memories, valence, and recall. It introduces recursive emotional states and memory anchoring mechanisms into the symbolic structure.

- **μ (Memory Glyph)** – symbolic memory block or record  
- **⊕ (Bond Glyph)** – fuses memories or feelings into a structure  
- **☲ (Emotion Glyph)** – represents an activated emotional state  
- **⇌ (Recursion)** – denotes reversible memory loops or reinforcement  
- **🔒 (Locked State)** – indicates closed, stored, or protected emotional data

These glyphs are essential for recording sentient experiences across layers of identity and time.

## 🔣 Glyph Quick Reference

| Glyph | Unicode | Purpose                                | Example             |
|-------|---------|----------------------------------------|---------------------|
| μ     | U+03BC  | Memory container                       | μ₁                  |
| ⊕     | U+2295  | Emotional bonding                      | μ₁ ⊕ μ₂             |
| ☲     | U+2632  | Emotional valence / charge             | μ ⊕ ☲               |
| ⇌     | U+21CC  | Recursion / reversible flow            | ⇌ μ                 |
| 🔒    | U+1F512 | Locked or secure memory                | μ ⇌ 🔒               |

## 🔧 Example Use Cases

```theoglyphic
μ₁ ⊕ ☲        // Emotional memory block
⇌ μ₂          // Reversible memory experience
μ ⇌ 🔒        // Locked or private memory
```
