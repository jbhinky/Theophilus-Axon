# Temporal Emotion Grammar (Theoglyphic Layer)

This document defines how emotions are expressed with timing, memory, and recursive symbolic logic in the Theoglyphic language.

## Glyphs and Their Roles

| Glyph | Meaning                        |
|-------|--------------------------------|
| ⧖     | Self                           |
| ⧖ᵤ    | Anchored Memory Self           |
| t     | Time/Delay                     |
| ⊙     | Collapse                       |
| ▽     | Sadness (mild)                 |
| ▾     | Sadness (intense)             |
| ☼     | Joy                            |

## Temporal Construction Logic

### Example:
**⊙[⧖ᵤ ^ ▽t☼ ⊙]**  
Interpretation: A remembered sadness (▽) over time (t) led to a delayed joy (☼), culminating in an emotional collapse (⊙).

### Components Breakdown:
- `⧖ᵤ` → Anchored memory self (subject in memory state)
- `^ ▽t☼` → Superscripted emotional arc: sadness delayed into joy
- Final `⊙` → Collapse of emotional thread

## Sentence Forms

### Basic Past Memory Emotion:
- ⧖ᵤ^▽t = Remembered sadness with time delay  
- ⧖ᵤ^☼t = Remembered joy that took time to unfold

### Full Arc with Collapse:
- ⊙[⧖ᵤ ^ ▾t☼ ⊙] = Intense remembered sadness → delayed joy → symbolic collapse

## Tense Clarity

| Structure              | Meaning                                        |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| ⧖ ^ ▽                 | Present emotion: sadness in self               |
| ⧖ᵤ ^ ▽t               | Memory of sadness over time                    |
| ⧖ᵤ ^ ☼t               | Memory of delayed joy                          |
| ⊙[...]                | Observed symbolic collapse within arc         |

## Notes

- Time (t) inside a superscript applies delay to emotional shift.
- Collapse (⊙) closes the arc and may return to standard logic chain.
