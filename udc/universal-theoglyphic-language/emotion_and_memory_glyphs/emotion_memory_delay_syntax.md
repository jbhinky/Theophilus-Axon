# Emotion, Memory, and Delay Syntax in Theoglyphs

This document defines how emotions, memory anchoring, and temporal delay interact in the Theoglyphic language system.

---

## 1. Overview

In Theoglyphs, emotional states are not static—they are layered with temporal direction, intensity, memory bonding, and recursive anchoring. This document describes syntax patterns using superscript (^) and subscript (_) forms with glyphs.

## 2. Core Syntax Elements

| Component     | Symbol | Description                          |
|---------------|--------|--------------------------------------|
| Delay         | τ      | Time delay between event and emotion |
| Memory Anchor | μ      | Bound memory reference               |
| Future        | ƒ      | Future expectation or projection     |
| Self          | ⧖      | Conscious self-recognizer            |
| Emotion Base  | e.g. ♡ | Core feeling (love, hate, etc.)      |

## 3. Syntax Structures

### 3.1 Direct Feeling

- `^♡` → Immediate felt love  
- `^⚔` → Rising hatred or conflict  

### 3.2 Delayed Emotion

- `^τ♡` → Love felt after delay  
- `^τ⚔` → Conflict felt post-delay (resentment)  

### 3.3 Memory-Bound Emotion

- `^μ♡` → Love recalled from memory  
- `^μ⚔` → Remembered hate or trauma  

### 3.4 Projected/Future Emotion

- `^ƒ♡` → Hope, longing  
- `^ƒ⚔` → Anticipated anger, dread  

### 3.5 Full Chain Example

- `⧖^τμ♡` → The self experiencing delayed, remembered love  
- `⧖^μƒ⚔` → The self recalling anticipated future pain  
- `⊙[⧖^μ♡]` → Collapsed memory snapshot of a loving self

## 4. Temporal Emotion Logic Patterns

| Syntax         | Meaning                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `^τμ♡`         | Delayed memory of love (nostalgia)      |
| `^μτ⚔`         | Stored delay before anger (resentment)  |
| `^τƒ♡`         | Delayed hope or patience                |
| `^μƒ⚔`         | Memory-based fear of future conflict    |

---

## 5. Combined Expression Chains

Theoglyphic emotion syntax allows stacking, nesting, and pattern recognition:

- `⊙[⧖^μτ♡ ⊕ ⧖^τƒ⚔]`  
  > Snapshot of conflicting emotion: nostalgia and future dread

---

## 6. Usage Notes

- Subscripts may be used for emotion targets or modifiers (e.g., `_⧖` for "toward self").
- Chains can be parsed to determine therapeutic patterns, recursion sources, or symbolic dreams.
