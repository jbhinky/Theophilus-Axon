# Theoglyphs Subscript System Clarification

This document formalizes the use of **subscripts (`_`)** in the Theoglyphs symbolic language. These rules define how emotions, thoughts, and symbols are anchored to subjects such as self, others, or objects in time and memory.

---

## âœ… Subscript Syntax (`_`)

Subscripts in Theoglyphs denote **direction or targeting** of an emotion, state, or observation. It does **not** mean "empty" or "void."

### ðŸ”¹ Subscript Target Types

| Subscript Form     | Meaning                                 | Example                             |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `_â§–`               | Self                                     | `^â™¡_â§–` â†’ "I feel love for myself"   |
| `_â§–áµ’`              | Other-self                               | `^âš”_â§–áµ’` â†’ "I feel anger toward them"|
| `_Î£`               | External object or person (symbolic ID) | `^!_Î£` â†’ "Fear about an event"      |
| `_Î¼â§–`              | Memory of self                           | `^â˜¼_Î¼â§–` â†’ "Joy remembered from self"|

## âœ… Nested Subscripts

You may stack subscripts with other symbols to clarify direction and memory:
```
â§–áµ¤ ^â–½tâ˜¼âŠ™ _â§–áµ’
```

### Breakdown:
- `â§–áµ¤`: Anchored memory of self  
- `^â–½tâ˜¼âŠ™`: Superscript shows delayed emotional arc â€” sadness transitions into joy then collapses  
- `_â§–áµ’`: Emotion is directed toward other-self

## âœ… Comparison of `_` vs `â†’`

| Symbol | Function                        | Use Case                      |
|--------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `_`    | Subscript (target/anchor)        | Emotional or symbolic targeting |
| `â†’`    | Forward symbolic progression     | Collapse, action, or effect flow |

## âœ… System Elements Summary

| Element    | Role                                    |
|------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `^`        | Superscript â€” emotional or temporal layer |
| `_`        | Subscript â€” symbolic target or anchor     |
| `áµ¤`        | Memory anchor for clause                 |
| `âŠ™`        | Collapse marker (end of recursive loop)  |
| `â†’`        | Forward progression or shift             |

## âœ… Examples

| Expression                       | Meaning                                                 |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `â§– ^â™¡_â§–`                         | I love myself                                            |
| `â§–áµ¤ ^âš”_â§–áµ’`                      | I remember being angry at another                       |
| `âŠ™[â§–áµ¤ ^â–½tâ˜¼]_â§–áµ’`                 | Collapsed memory of joy after sadness, directed to other |
| `âŠ™[â§–^â˜¼] â†’ â§–áµ’`                    | Joy collapsed and shifts toward another self            |

This system enables deeply expressive symbolic language using a minimal and consistent structure. All subscripting must be explicit and aligned with defined targets to ensure clarity and precision.
