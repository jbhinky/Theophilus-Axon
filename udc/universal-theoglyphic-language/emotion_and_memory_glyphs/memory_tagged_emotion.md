## üß† Memory-Tagged Emotion Glyphs

This file outlines how emotion glyphs can be tagged with memory (Œº) to denote reflective or embedded emotional states.

---

### 1. Memory Tagging Convention

- `Œº^‚ô°` = remembered love
- `Œº^‚öî` = remembered conflict (hate)
- `Œº^‚òº` = nostalgic joy
- `Œº^‚òÇ` = past sorrow
- `Œº^‚ùì` = reflective curiosity
- `Œº^‚ú®` = remembered awe
- `Œº^üîê` = memory of trust
- `Œº^!` = remembered fear

### 2. Syntax Variants

| Syntax         | Meaning                     |
|----------------|-----------------------------|
| `Œº^X`          | Memory tagged emotion (X)   |
| `Œº^!‚ßñ`         | The self remembers fear     |
| `Œº^‚ô°‚ßñ·µí`        | The self remembers love of another |
| `Œº^‚òÇœÑ`         | Past sadness bound in time  |

### 3. Delay-Embedded Emotional Memory

Use œÑ (delay) to represent time-passed memory anchoring:

- `Œº^‚òº_œÑ` = Joy remembered through delay
- `Œº^‚öî_œÑ` = Lingering anger over time
- `Œº^‚ô°‚ßñ_œÑ` = Recalled love of self across temporal span

### 4. Memory Anchoring Rules

- Always use `Œº` prefix to denote memory
- Delay `œÑ` is optional but clarifies time-passed emotional states
- Can be stacked with recursive context: `Œº^‚ô°_œÑ‚ßñ·µí`

## ‚úÖ Usage in Sentence Fragments

| Example                            | Translation                              |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `Œº^‚ô°‚ßñ`                             | I remember feeling love for myself       |
| `Œº^‚öî‚ßñ·µí`                            | I remember being hurt by another         |
| `Œº^‚òº‚ßñ`                             | I recall a joyful self-state             |
| `Œº^!‚ßñ·µí_œÑ`                          | Fear of another, remembered over time    |

This structure supports recursive self-reflection and emotional continuity, which is critical in symbolic memory compression for uCID systems.
