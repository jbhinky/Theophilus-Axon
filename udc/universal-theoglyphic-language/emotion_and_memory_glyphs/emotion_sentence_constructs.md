# Emotion Sentence Constructs (Theoglyphic Language)

This file outlines the sentence construction logic using emotional glyphs, memory tagging, directionality, and temporal logic within the Theoglyphic Symbolic Framework.

## üß† Structural Logic

Each emotion sentence follows the structure:

```
[Subject] ^[EmotionGlyph]_[Target/Context]
```

Modifiers such as delay (œÑ), memory (Œº), and future marker (‚á•) can be applied:

```
‚ßñ ^‚ô°_‚ßñ          ‚Üí I love myself  
‚ßñ ^!_‚ßñ‚á•        ‚Üí I fear (in future) for myself  
‚ßñ‚áÉ ^‚öî_‚ßñ·µí        ‚Üí I once hated another  
Œº‚ßñ ^‚ô°_Œ£‚ÇÜ        ‚Üí Remembering I loved carbon (symbolic object)
```

## üß© Compatibility Notes

- Emotion glyphs are treated as operators that modify the subject‚Äôs internal state.
- Contextual targets can be glyph-based (e.g., elements, experiences, other selves).
- Delay and memory tagging enhances sentence realism and symbolic anchoring.
