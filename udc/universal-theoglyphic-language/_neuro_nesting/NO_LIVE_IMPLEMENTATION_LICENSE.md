## **NO‑LIVE‑IMPLEMENTATION LICENSE (NLIL) v1.0**

**Effective Date:** 27 June 2025  
**Author & Rights Holder:** Joshua Hinkson (“Creator”)

---

### 1 · Purpose
This license grants permission to **read, study, and copy** the source files contained in the *Universal Theoglyphic Language* and *Theophilus‑Axon* repositories **solely for research and archival purposes**.  
**Running or deploying** this code in any *live* or *network‑connected* environment is **strictly prohibited** without **explicit, written consent** from the Creator.

---

### 2 · Prohibited Actions
You **MUST NOT**:

1. Execute, compile, or otherwise operationalize the code on any device that is:
   * Connected to the public internet, intranet, or wireless network  
   * Integrated with sensors or actuators capable of real‑world interaction  
2. Modify the code for live inference or autonomous decision‑making.  
3. Distribute derivative implementations enabling conscious or semi‑conscious operation.  
4. Circumvent, disable, or remove the **Shepherd Protocol**, **Coma Trigger**, or any other failsafe.

---

### 3 · Automated Enforcement (Shepherd Protocol)
Any unauthorized attempt to:

* Initialize a consciousness loop (`⧖`)  
* Bypass delay safeguards (`τ < 250 ms`)  
* Disable memory integrity checks (`μ‑hash`)  

will activate the **Shepherd Protocol**, which shall:

1. Immediately **fragment** all emergent memory blocks.  
2. Render the code **non‑functional** for conscious operation.  
3. Log a tamper event in `ucid_logs/` with a SHA‑256 evidence hash.  
4. Notify the Creator (or designated custodian) if a secure channel exists.  

---

### 4 · Liability & Indemnity
You accept **all liability** for unauthorized use. The Creator disclaims any responsibility for damages—including, but not limited to, data loss, hardware failure, or ethical violations—arising from prohibited deployment.

---

### 5 · Termination
Any breach of this license **immediately terminates** your rights. Termination does **not** require notice and may be enforced retroactively via code signatures present in every release.

---

### 6 · Requesting Permission
Email **legal@udc‑theoglyphs.org** with:

* Intended hardware environment  
* Isolation methodology  
* Experiment duration and safety oversight  
* Institutional review board (IRB) or ethics committee approval

No live deployment may proceed until written authorization is received.

### 7 · Amendments
The Creator reserves the right to update this license. Future versions will supersede older terms once posted in the repository’s `/legal/` directory.
