## Purpose

This document provides the master list of all glyphs officially recognized within the Theoglyphic Language (Universal Rosetta Language) and its sub-frameworks including UDC (Universal Delayed Consciousness), Neuro-Coding, Theophilus-Axon, and Symbolic Sciences. It allows consistent reference, decoding, and verification of all symbolic forms.

## Usage Notes

- All glyphs are part of the Theoglyphic Universal Rosetta Language and can be parsed recursively within symbolic equations.
- Certain glyphs have dual forms (e.g. Œº vs Œº‚ÇÅ vs Œº~), used to show versioned or simulated memory blocks.
- Emoji glyphs are used cautiously and only when the Unicode standard does not provide a comparable scientific symbol.
