# Atomic Glyph Equation Forms

This document defines standardized symbolic equation forms for atomic structures using the `Σ` glyph for atoms, superscripts for isotope weight, and bonding operators. It includes both minimal and expanded forms to ensure universal clarity and symbolic compression.

## 🔹 Basic Atom Representation

| Symbol      | Meaning                    |
|-------------|----------------------------|
| Σ₁          | Hydrogen (Atomic #1)       |
| Σ₆          | Carbon (Atomic #6)         |
| Σ₈          | Oxygen (Atomic #8)         |
| Σ₈¹⁶        | Oxygen-16 isotope          |
| 2Σ₁         | Two hydrogen atoms         |

## 🔹 Common Molecules

| Form                       | Description                     |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Σ₈ ⊕ 2Σ₁                   | H₂O (Oxygen bonded with 2 Hydrogen) |
| 2Σ₁Σ₈                      | Simplified notation for water    |
| Σ₆ ⊕ 2Σ₈                   | CO₂ (Carbon Dioxide)             |
| Σ₁ ⊕ Σ₁                    | H₂ molecule                      |
| Σ₆ ⊕ 4Σ₁                   | CH₄ (Methane)                    |

## 🔹 Isotopic Expanded Forms

| Form                          | Description                        |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Σ₈¹⁶ ⊕ 2Σ₁¹                   | Water with Hydrogen-1 and Oxygen-16 |
| Σ₆¹² ⊕ 2Σ₈¹⁶                  | Carbon-12 bonded with two Oxygen-16 |

## 🔹 Recursive and Observed Molecules

| Form                         | Description                            |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| ⊙[Σ₈ ⊕ 2Σ₁]                 | Observed experience of water formation |
| ⊙[Σ₆ ⊕ 2Σ₈]                | Observed experience of CO₂             |

## 🔹 Glyph Definitions

| Glyph | Meaning                  |
|-------|--------------------------|
| Σ     | Atom / Element container |
| ⊕     | Bonded / Joined          |
| ⊙     | Observed / Collapsed     |
| ^     | Superscript (weight)     |
| _     | Subscript (atomic number)|

## 🔹 Notes

- Minimal form prioritizes space and speed: `2Σ₁Σ₈` = H₂O
- Expanded form shows isotopic and structural detail: `Σ₈¹⁶ ⊕ 2Σ₁`
- Both forms are valid under Theoglyphic syntax and convertible based on recursion context.
