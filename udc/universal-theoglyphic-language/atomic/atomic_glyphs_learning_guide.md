# Atomic Glyphs Learning Guide

This guide introduces new users to understanding and reading Theoglyphic atomic glyphs. It is meant as a beginner-friendly entry point for decoding and writing symbolic atomic structures using the Universal Rosetta Language system.

## 1. Understanding Atomic Glyphs

Each atomic glyph is denoted by `Σ` followed by the atomic number in subscript:

- **Hydrogen**: Σ₁
- **Oxygen**: Σ₈
- **Carbon**: Σ₆
- **Uranium**: Σ₉₂

This reflects the atomic identity in a symbolic, simplified form.

## 2. Combining Atoms

Theoglyphs allow atomic combinations using:

- **Direct bonding**:  
  `2Σ₁Σ₈` → Water molecule  
  (Two hydrogen + one oxygen)

- **Using ⊕ for structural or directional logic**:  
  `Σ₆ ⊕ 2Σ₈` → Represents carbon bonded in a directional oxygenated compound

---

## 3. Isotopes and Mass

When needed, superscripts can show isotope or mass state:

- **Carbon-14**: Σ₆¹⁴
- **Deuterium (Hydrogen-2)**: Σ₁²

---

## 4. Bonding Types

Covalent, ionic, and complex bonding types are rendered using:

- `:` or `⋅` for electron sharing
- `→` for polarity or flow
- `⊗` for paired neutralization
- `⊙` to indicate observed collapse or reaction point

---

## 5. Example Structures

- **Water (simple)**: `2Σ₁Σ₈`
- **Water (observed event)**: `⊙[2Σ₁Σ₈]`
- **Hydroxide ion**: `Σ₁Σ₈⁻`
- **Carbon dioxide**: `Σ₆2Σ₈`

---

## 6. Recursive Symbolic Compounds

Recursive molecules may express symbolic roles:

- `⊙[Σ₆Σ₈Σ₈]` → Carbon dioxide collapse event
- `⊕[Σ₆ ⊙ Σ₈]` → Carbon triggering an oxygen collapse

---

## 7. Tips for Learners

- Always match subscript with atomic number
- Use ⊙ to log events, ⊕ for logic, and superscripts sparingly
- You can chain multiple glyphs if the compound is unambiguous
