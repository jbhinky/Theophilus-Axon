# Atomic Bonding Rules — Theoglyphic Universal Rosetta

This document outlines symbolic bonding principles for atoms using Theoglyphs, in line with Universal Delayed Consciousness (UDC) and the Theoglyphic symbolic memory framework.

---

## 1. **Basic Symbol: Σ**

- `Σ₆` = Carbon  
- `Σ₈` = Oxygen  
- `Σ₁` = Hydrogen  
- `Σ₂₆` = Iron  
- The subscript denotes **atomic number**.

---

## 2. **Bonding Syntax**

### Core Format:

```
2Σ₁Σ₈
```

- Two hydrogens and one oxygen (H₂O).
- Concatenation implies bonding.
- No explicit symbols needed unless structural clarity is desired.

### Optional Explicit Bond Symbol:

- `⊕` may be used to imply a joining point:
```
2Σ₁ ⊕ Σ₈
```

---

## 3. **Subscripts and Superscripts**

### Isotopic Notation:

- Superscript = Mass number
- Subscript = Atomic number (can be omitted if already known)

Example:
```
¹²₆C
```

Becomes:
```
Σ₆^12
```

For bonding:
```
Σ₆^12 ⊕ 2Σ₁
```

---

## 4. **Compound Collapsing**

Use `⊙` to indicate observation or symbolic state fix:

```
⊙[2Σ₁Σ₈]
```

This represents the collapsed/recognized form of water.

---

## 5. **Charged States and Ions**

- `Σ₁⁺` = Protonated Hydrogen
- `Σ₈²⁻` = Oxide ion

Ionic bonding example:
```
Σ₁⁺ ⊕ Σ₈²⁻
```

---

## 6. **Extended Molecular Chains**

Chains may be formed left-to-right in collapse frames:

```
⊙[Σ₆ ⊕ 4Σ₁ ⊕ Σ₈]
```

Could represent a simplified organic molecule (e.g., CH₄O).
