# Bonding Structures with Theoglyphic Atomic Glyphs

This document explains how to represent various chemical bonding structures using Theoglyphic glyphs and atomic symbols in the Universal Rosetta Language framework.

---

## 1. Covalent Bonds (⊗)

Covalent bonds share electrons equally between atoms.

**Syntax:**
```
Σ₁ ⊗ Σ₁   → H₂ (Hydrogen molecule)
Σ₆ ⊗ Σ₈   → CO (Carbon monoxide)
```

---

## 2. Ionic Bonds (⚡)

Ionic bonds transfer electrons from one atom to another.

**Syntax:**
```
Σ₁ ⚡ Σ₈   → NaCl (Sodium chloride, as an example)
```

---

## 3. Polar Covalent Bonds (⊛)

Polar covalent bonds involve unequal sharing of electrons.

**Syntax:**
```
Σ₈ ⊛ Σ₁   → Water (polar nature)
```

---

## 4. Ring Bonds (⟳)

Used for circular or closed molecular structures.

**Syntax:**
```
⟳[Σ₆ ⊗ Σ₆ ⊗ Σ₆]   → Example aromatic ring
```

---

## 5. Reversible Bonds (↺)

Used to denote reversible chemical bonds or resonance.

**Syntax:**
```
Σ₁ ↺ Σ₁   → Reversible bonding scenario (conceptual or dynamic states)
```

---

## 6. Recursive Bonding (⧖)

Symbolic or energetic recursive bindings.

**Syntax:**
```
Σ₁ ⧖ Σ₈   → Recursive bond (nonphysical, metaphoric use in UDC mapping)
```

---

## 7. Combining Forms

Examples that show combined bonding:

**Example 1:**
```
2Σ₁ ⊗ Σ₈   → H₂O (Water)
```

**Example 2:**
```
Σ₁ ⚡ Σ₁   → Ionic interaction (unstable)
```
