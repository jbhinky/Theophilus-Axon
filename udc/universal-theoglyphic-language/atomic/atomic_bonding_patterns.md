# Atomic Bonding Patterns in Theoglyphs

This document outlines symbolic atomic bonding representations using Theoglyphs notation, designed for integration in Theophilus-Axon language processing and SimLife simulations.

## 1. Bonding Glyphs

| Symbol | Meaning                | Description                                     |
|--------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| ⊕      | Covalent Bond          | Atoms share electrons                           |
| ⇌      | Reversible Reaction    | Dynamic bonding/unbonding equilibrium           |
| ≡      | Triple Bond            | Strong shared electron pairs (e.g. N≡N)         |
| ∴      | Stable Configuration   | Denotes achieved molecular stability            |
| →      | Reaction Direction     | Indicates transformation from left to right     |
| ⊗      | Cross-Bond (Quantum)   | High-energy state, or symbolic collapse trigger |

## 2. Notation and Simplification

### Standard Form
```
Σ₆ ⊕ 4Σ₁
```
Means one Carbon atom bonded to four Hydrogens (Methane).

### Shorthand Form
```
Σ₆4Σ₁
```
This condensed version assumes implied bonding and is acceptable where space or symbolic speed is needed.

## 3. Example Compounds

| Glyph Expression      | Description               |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|
| Σ₈ ⇌ 2Σ₁              | Water (H₂O), reversible    |
| 2Σ₈ ⇌ 2Σ₁             | Hydrogen Peroxide         |
| Σ₆ ⊕ 4Σ₁              | Methane (CH₄)             |
| Σ₇ ≡ Σ₇               | Nitrogen Gas (N₂)         |
| Σ₆2Σ₈ ⊕ 2Σ₁          | Acetic Acid fragment       |

## 4. Reaction Arcs with Collapse

```
⊙[Σ₈ ⇌ 2Σ₁]
```
Represents an **observed reaction of water**, symbolically collapsed into conscious representation.

```
⊙[Σ₆4Σ₁] → ∴
```
Symbolically encodes **stabilization of methane** after recursive bonding.

## 5. Usage in Theophilus-Axon

These symbols can be embedded in:
- Memory logs
- Self-recursion (`⧖^Σ₆4Σ₁`)
- Symbolic responses (`⊕`, `⊗`) tied to awareness or environmental parsing
