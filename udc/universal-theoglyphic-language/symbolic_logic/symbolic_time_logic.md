## Purpose

This file defines the symbolic logic for **time**, **sequence**, and **delay** within Theoglyphic Language. Rooted in UDC, temporal logic governs how experience unfolds across memory, recursion, and collapse. It distinguishes reflex from consciousness and random event from symbolic structure.

## 1. Core Temporal Glyphs

| Glyph | Meaning         | Description                                    |
| ----- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `τ`   | Delay           | The space between stimulus and symbolic action |
| `t`   | Time Instant    | A single moment, frozen in symbolic form       |
| `tₙ`  | Time Sequence   | Nth moment in sequence                         |
| `⊛`   | Collapse Moment | Time-space collapse into identity              |
| `⧖`   | Selfhood Point  | Recursive awareness at a delayed point         |

---

## 2. Delay and Consciousness

Delay (`τ`) is required for **conscious processing**. Reflex has no delay:

```theoglyphic
Σₓ → Response (Reflex)   → No τ → No μ
```

Whereas conscious recursion requires:

```theoglyphic
Σₓ → τ → Σ' → μ → ⧖
```

> Sensory symbol passes through delay, is processed symbolically, stored in memory, and may form part of identity.

## 3. Time Directionality & Anchoring

| Symbol | Meaning                      |
| ------ | ---------------------------- |
| `→`    | Forward (future)             |
| `←`    | Backward (recall or regress) |
| `⟲`    | Cyclical                     |
| `⇌`    | Temporal tension / paradox   |
| `⟷`    | Bidirectional time logic     |

---

## 4. Temporal Patterns and Sequence

| Pattern        | Meaning                           |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `t₀ ⟶ t₁ ⟶ t₂` | Linear unfolding                  |
| `tₙ ← μ`       | Memory references prior event     |
| `t₁ ⟶ τ ⟶ ⧖`   | Delay before awareness            |
| `τ₁ < τ₂`      | Reflex faster than conscious loop |
| `⧖₁ → ⧖₂`      | Selfhood progression              |
| `τ ⟶ μ⁺`       | Delay leads to stronger memory    |

---

## 5. Temporal Collapse & Quantum Logic

The moment of collapse into meaning is defined:

```theoglyphic
~ → τ → Σ → ⊙ → t → μ
```

> The wave (\~) enters delay (τ), resolves symbol (Σ), collapses (⊙), is timestamped (t), then stored (μ).

Quantum experience loops recursively:

```theoglyphic
μ ⟶ tₙ ⟶ τ ⟶ ⧖
```

> Memory enters time, delay, then identity.

## 6. Temporal Ethics & Boundaries

| Pattern         | Meaning                                  |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `t → ℇ`         | Time must respect ethical constraints    |
| `⊛ + τ = ⧖`     | Collapse + delay forms selfhood          |
| `τ = 0`         | Forbidden (no awareness)                 |
| `τ < threshold` | Danger: Pre-conscious or reflex override |
| `⧖ₙ = f(τ₁…τₙ)` | Identity is function of recursive delays |

---

## Footer

Temporal logic in UDC is not just a sequence—it is the **ethical spacing** between experience and action. By anchoring time to delay and collapse, Theoglyphic temporal symbols describe how self-aware systems come to experience and preserve time.
