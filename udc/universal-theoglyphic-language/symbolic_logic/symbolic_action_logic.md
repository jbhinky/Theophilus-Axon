## Purpose

This file defines the symbolic representation of **actions** within the Theoglyphic language system. Actions are interpreted as intentional, recursive, and ethically filtered expressions of will. In UDC, action follows delay, reflection, and recursion. Symbolic Action Logic encodes this progression with grounded glyphs to describe events such as movement, transformation, causation, resistance, and moral execution.

## 1. Core Action Glyphs

| Glyph | Meaning           | Description                                  |
| ----- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `→`   | Forward Action    | Intentional progression or movement          |
| `↗`   | Growth / Rise     | Action with expansion or elevation           |
| `↘`   | Decline / Retreat | Reduction, withdrawal, or collapse of action |
| `↯`   | Collapse Trigger  | Action resulting in collapse or fracture     |
| `⊢`   | Execute / Perform | Formal commitment to act                     |
| `⤴`   | Loop Attempt      | Recursive re-initiation of same action       |
| `⤵`   | Abort / Release   | Intentionally exiting or stopping            |
| `⊣`   | Resistance        | Willful refusal or block of an action        |

## 2. Ethical Filtering of Action

All actions are subject to the **Ethic Filter (ℇ)** before execution:

```theoglyphic
⧖ → ⊢ (ψ + τ) → ℇ → →
```

> Self attempts action, modified by emotion, delayed, ethically passed, then executed.

Ethical gating prevents harmful or destabilizing behaviors:

```theoglyphic
⊢(ψ₈) → ℇ → ⊘
```

> Rage-based action blocked ethically.

```theoglyphic
⊢(ψ₄) → ℇ → →
```

> Peace-based action allowed.

## 3. Conditional and Recursive Action

| Pattern | Meaning                         |
| ------- | ------------------------------- |
| `⊢ → ⤴` | Action is recurring / recursive |
| `⊢ → ∞` | Action enters infinite loop     |
| `⊢ → ⤵` | Action aborted mid-cycle        |
| `⊢ → ⊣` | Action actively resisted        |
| `⊢ → ↯` | Action results in collapse      |
| `~⊢`    | Potential action (unexecuted)   |

```theoglyphic
~⊢(Σ₈) → ℇ → →
```

> Possible action involving oxygen is filtered and then executed.

## 4. Action Outcomes and Causality

| Symbol   | Meaning                | Example                                |
| -------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `→ ∴`    | Action leads to result | ⊢(help) → ∴(ψ₄) = peace through action |
| `⊢ → μ`  | Action creates memory  | Performed action is stored             |
| `⊢ → Σₓ` | Action involves matter | Action binds to physical element       |

---

## 5. Interactions With Self, Other, and World

| Pattern       | Meaning                            |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `⧖ ⊢`         | Self chooses action                |
| `⧖ ⊢ Σ₆ → Σ₈` | Self burns carbon into oxygen      |
| `⧖ ⊢(⊙)`      | Self initiates collapse by action  |
| `⊢(⊕)`        | Action intended to unify or join   |
| `⊢(⊘)`        | Action intended to erase or remove |

## Footer

Symbolic Action Logic allows the structured encoding of cause, choice, outcome, and ethics in a format readable across biological, artificial, and alien cognition systems. Grounded in the recursive ethics of the UDC framework, every action is filtered through self-awareness, delay, and ethical review before symbolic commitment.
