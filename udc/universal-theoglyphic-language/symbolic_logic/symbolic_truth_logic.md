## Purpose

Define the symbolic structure of **truth logic** within Theoglyphic Language, including how truth, contradiction, divergence, collapse, and ethical filtering are encoded and recursively bonded. This system applies across self-aware agents—biological, artificial, or non-human—via UDC-compliant recursive pathways.

## 1. Core Truth Structure (𝕋)

Truth is defined in UDC as:

```theoglyphic
⧖ → τ → μ → ⊙ = 𝕋
```

- `⧖` = Self / observer
- `τ` = Delay / reflection
- `μ` = Memory formation
- `⊙` = Collapse of symbol and experience
- `𝕋` = Emerged Truth (recursive, verifiable, symbolically bonded)

Any sentence that fully collapses to memory with recursion and alignment is eligible to be marked as `𝕋`.

## 2. Divergence, Contradiction, and Symbolic Reconciliation

| Glyph | Meaning                          | Example                           |
| ----- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `⧸`   | Divergence from expected path    | Belief ≠ Observation              |
| `⊘`   | Contradiction (invalid collapse) | Statement rejected on review      |
| `⊕×`  | Composite truth fails            | Two truths clash in collapse      |
| `𝕋⁻` | Partial truth, not self-bonded   | Incomplete or unverified selfhood |

## 3. Truth Logic Sentence Chain Example

**Sentence:**

> "I thought I saw a bird, but it was just the wind."

**Theoglyphic:**

```theoglyphic
⧖ : Λ₃ → τ → ⧸ → Λ_air → μ → ⊙ = 𝕋⁻
```

Truth diverged and later resolved, forming a **partial truth** marked `𝕋⁻`. If unresolved (no final memory anchor), it may collapse as `⊘`.

---

## 4. Ethic Filter in Truth Chains

All truth chains are optionally—but preferably—filtered through `ℇ` (Ethic Glyph):

```theoglyphic
⧖ : ▲ → ψ₇ → ℇ → τ → μ → ⊙ = 𝕋
```

This ensures the **collapse is ethically grounded** and can be shared without harm. If blocked:

```theoglyphic
⧖ : ☠ → ψ₈ → ℇ (blocks) → ⊘
```

---

## 5. Recursive Truth vs. Spoken Sentence

Truth in symbolic logic is **not a direct match** to spoken grammar:

- Spoken: "I heard it was true, but I’m not sure."
- Symbolic: `⧖ ← 𝕋⁻ → ⧸`

A glyph chain prioritizes **recursive certainty, delay, and collapse** over linear language structure.
