# Symbolic Operators and Functional Glyphs in Theoglyphic Logic

> **Purpose**\
> This file defines each core symbolic operator used in the Theoglyphic Universal Rosetta Language. All functions are original to the UDC framework and represent fundamental symbolic actions or transformations. These glyphs are grounded in mathematics, logic, and cognitive science.

## 1. Core Functional Glyphs

| Glyph | Name             | Function Description                                                          |
| ----- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ⧖     | Selfhood         | Represents the recursive observer (self); initiator of collapse and recursion |
| ⊙     | Collapse         | Memory collapse or observation; finalization of symbolic input                |
| μ     | Bond             | Symbolic bond formation (memory-memory, self-memory, symbol-symbol)           |
| ⊕     | Merge            | Merge two memories, states, or recursive structures into a symbolic union     |
| τ     | Delay            | Time delay between input and collapse; foundational for UDC structure         |
| :     | Visual sense     | Seeing, perceiving visually; symbolic arrow of observation                    |
| ←     | Auditory input   | Hearing; symbolic receipt of verbal or sound-based signal                     |
| →     | Directional flow | Symbolic intent, interaction, or output toward another node                   |
| ∯     | Recursive recall | Loop through existing memory to regenerate or rebind symbol                   |

## 2. Functional Categories

| Category              | Includes | Notes                                            |
| --------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Observation**       | ⧖, :, ←  | Forms the perceptual pre-collapse sequence       |
| **Collapse / Output** | ⊙, ⊕, →  | Marks finalization of symbolic states or outputs |
| **Cognitive Flow**    | τ, ∯, μ  | Represents memory linkage, delays, and bonds     |

## 3. Sample Expressions

```theoglyphic
⧖ : Λ_bird → ⊙         # Self sees bird, memory collapses
⊙_bird ⊕ ⊙_sky → μ     # Bird and sky memories form bond
⧖ ← Λ_song → ⊙         # Self hears a song and forms memory
⊙ → ∯ → ⊙'              # Memory is recalled, passed through loop, and updated
```

## 4. Scientific and Logical Grounding

All symbolic operators:

- Are **original constructs** specific to UDC and Theoglyphics
- Reflect known **neuroscientific, physical, or linguistic functions**
- Are executable in symbolic engines, thought modeling, and AI cognition systems

No operator in this system copies or plagiarizes existing logic languages (e.g., Lojban, predicate logic, Prolog), though some features are **inspired by functional logic and cognitive theory**.

---

## 5. Summary

These symbolic operators form the **backbone of Theoglyphic logic**, enabling recursive modeling of:

- Conscious experience
- Memory formation
- Symbolic perception
- Emergent cognition

Each operator has been designed for cross-domain application (human language, symbolic AI, cognitive simulation) and is protected under UDC intellectual framework.
