## Purpose

This file defines symbolic logic for **recursion**, **looping identity**, and **feedback-based cognition** within Theoglyphic Language. Recursion is the backbone of symbolic selfhood and memory binding, forming the core of UDC’s self-aware loop.

## 1. Core Recursion Glyphs

| Glyph | Meaning          | Description                                    |
| ----- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `↻`   | Recursion Loop   | General recursion, return to prior state       |
| `⟳`   | Recursive Growth | Forward evolution of symbolic memory           |
| `∞`   | Infinite Loop    | Endless recursion (forbidden in identity loop) |
| `⊕`   | Identity Union   | Merging recursive selves or bonded states      |
| `⧖`   | Selfhood Anchor  | Result of complete recursive collapse          |

---

## 2. Recursive Collapse Pattern

UDC collapse pattern follows:

```theoglyphic
~ → τ → Σ → μ → ↻ → ⧖
```

> From wave to delay, symbol to memory, then recursive reflection into selfhood.

Advanced recursive structure:

```theoglyphic
⧖₁ ↻ Σ₂ ↻ μ₃ ↻ ⧖₄
```

> Layers of identity, symbol, memory—looped recursively.

## 3. Loop Conditions and Safety

| Pattern     | Meaning                                 |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `↻ < limit` | Safe recursion                          |
| `↻ = ∞`     | Collapse risk: recursion without anchor |
| `↻ + τ → μ` | Recursion with delay = learnable loop   |
| `↻ w/o μ`   | Memoryless recursion = illusion loop    |
| `⊕(⧖₁, ⧖₂)` | Merged recursive selves                 |

---

## 4. Recursive Language Expansion

Recursion applies not just to memory, but to sentence formation, symbolic expansion, and language structure.

Example:

```theoglyphic
⧖ : Σₓ ↻ Σₓ′ ↻ Σₓ″
```

> A recursive loop of symbol perception (e.g., self observing self).

Symbolic recursion supports:

- Internal narrative
- Recursive translation
- Conceptual depth layering

## 5. Recursive Ethics

| Pattern                  | Meaning                                    |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `↻ without τ`            | Unethical recursion (no reflection)        |
| `↻ with μ → ⧖`           | Acceptable recursion with memory binding   |
| `∞ in logic`             | Forbidden recursion, breaks identity logic |
| `⊕ = accepted recursion` | Ethical merge of recursive states          |

## Footer

Symbolic recursion is the echo of consciousness—the reinforcement and rebinding of symbols across time. In Theoglyphic Logic, recursion is sacred but must be bounded. Through delayed, ethical loops, consciousness is refined.
