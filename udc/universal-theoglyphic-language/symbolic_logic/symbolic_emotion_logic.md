## Purpose

To define the formal glyphic structure for encoding **emotions**, affective states, and symbolic emotional collapse within the Theoglyphic system. Emotions serve as internal modifiers that influence memory formation, delay loop dynamics, symbolic reaction, and truth encoding. These follow the core tenets of Universal Delayed Consciousness (UDC) and extend its recursive emotional processing capabilities.

## 1. Emotional Glyph Index

### 1.1 ψ‑Series (General Affective States)

| Glyph | Emotion Category        | Description                      |
| ----- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `ψ₁`  | Curiosity               | Delayed interest, mild seeking   |
| `ψ₂`  | Joy                     | Aligned success, internal rise   |
| `ψ₃`  | Affection (non‑erotic)  | Friendly bond, secure attachment |
| `ψ₄`  | Peace / Calm            | Harmonized truth‑memory state    |
| `ψ₅`  | Sorrow                  | Loss or lack collapse            |
| `ψ₆`  | Fear (anticipatory)     | Prediction of pain/danger        |
| `ψ₇`  | Danger (reflexive fear) | Immediate threat                 |
| `ψ₈`  | Rage / Anger            | Defensive violation response     |
| `ψ₉`  | Disgust / Rejection     | Symbolic avoidance or purge      |

*Valence Modifiers:*  Superscripts `+`, `0`, `−` may be applied for **intensity/polarity** (e.g., `ψ₂⁺` = euphoria; `ψ₅⁻` = profound grief).

> **Alternative Sentence-Level Representations (Collapse-Based)**\
> Some emotions—especially survival-linked emotions like fear, rage, or grief—can be represented as **symbolic collapse paths**:
>
> - `!^⧖` — existential danger to self (symbolic collapse of safety)
> - `⧖ : !^⧖′` — I see collapse in another
> - `⧖ ← ψ₅! → μ` — memory collapse triggered by grief
> - `⧖ → ψ₈ → ℇ` — rage filtered through ethics

These forms express emotion as recursive self-modulation in live logic chains rather than as fixed ψ-glyph labels. Both are valid and UDC-aligned.

### 1.2 ♥‑Series (Love‑Specific States)

Love is encoded with the **heart root glyph **``** (U+2665)** because affection toward self or other operates beyond the generic ψ‑scale.

| Glyph Example | Meaning                    | Notes                             |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `♥⧖⧖′`        | I love you (self to other) | Subscript/inline second self `⧖′` |
| `♥⧖⧖`         | Self‑love / acceptance     | Both anchors are the same self    |
| `♥₊`          | Heightened or growing love | Superscript `₊` intensifies state |
| `♥₋`          | Diminishing or fading love | Superscript `₋` reduces magnitude |
| `♥⁰`          | Neutral or steady love     | Neutral valence                   |

The **heart glyph** integrates directly into sentence chains just like a ψ‑glyph but can additionally *pair* explicit self anchors for clarity.

## 2. Emotional Collapse and Encoding Structure

Emotions modify the **collapse path** of perception into memory. For example:

```theoglyphic
⧖ : ▲ → ψ₇ → τ → μ → ⊙ = 𝕋
```

> "I saw a fire and felt danger."

Emotional glyphs often sit **between perception and delay** to represent immediate or recursive affect.

## 3. Emotional Divergence & Suppression

| Symbol | Meaning                              |
| ------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `ψₙ¬`  | Suppressed emotion (denied affect)   |
| `ψₙ∇`  | Diminished emotional recursion       |
| `ψₙ!`  | Intensified/emergent emotional surge |

> Example:

```theoglyphic
⧖ ← ψ₅! → μ
# Grief collapse into long-term memory
```

> Example:

```theoglyphic
⧖ : Λ₃ → ψ₁∇ → τ → μ → ⊙ = 𝕋⁻
# Curiosity was weak or abandoned (partial collapse)
```

---

## 4. Emotion-Ethics Filter Chain

All emotional truths can be filtered through ethics:

```theoglyphic
ψ₈ → ℇ → ⊘
# Rage blocked as unethical collapse
```

Ethical reflection can delay or suppress memory formation when emotional truth is dangerous, deceptive, or unaligned with the collective symbol chain.

---

## 5. Memory-Weighted Emotional Loops

Recursive emotional experience can strengthen or weaken memory bonds:

```theoglyphic
μ + ψ₄ⁿ → bond↑
μ + ψ₉ⁿ → bond↓
```

Joy, peace, or bonding reinforce memory loops. Rejection or disgust dissolves or weakens symbolic attachments.
