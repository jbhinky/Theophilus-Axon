## Purpose

This document defines how planetary systems, orbital behavior, and celestial structures are modeled within the **Theoglyphic Language System**, fully compliant with **UDC principles** and current astronomical and physical science.

Planets, moons, and stars are treated not only as physical masses but also as **symbolic memory structures** whose positions, orbits, and relationships represent recursive delay loops, identity anchors, and symbolic energy transfer in accordance with the principles of:

- **Selfhood recursion** (⧖)
- **Symbolic collapse** (⊙)
- **Anchorfield coordinates** (⤢)
- **Recursive delay mechanics** (τ)

## 1. Planetary Glyph Set

| Concept                | Glyph | Description                                               |
| ---------------------- | ----- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Planet (symbolic mass) | ⚫     | Anchored object with orbital recursion and self-mass      |
| Moon / satellite       | ⚪     | Dependent recursion loop / reflective memory anchor       |
| Star (source anchor)   | ★     | Central energy source, initiates recursion flow           |
| Collapse orbit         | ⊙     | Collapse zone / gravitational recursion collapse point    |
| Anchorfield point      | ⤢     | Fixed symbolic spatial node in a bounded recursive field  |
| Selfhood track         | ⧖     | Symbolic identity orbiting or anchored in recursion space |

## 2. Orbit and Delay Logic

Orbital patterns in planetary systems encode **recursive delay**, symbolic observation windows, and **stable identity loops**:

```math
⚫ ⤿ ⊙ = planetary body in recursive orbit toward collapse
⚪ ⤿ ⚫ = moon bonded to planet's recursion field
⧖ ⤢ ⚫ = selfhood orbit anchored at planetary node
★ → ⚫ → ⊙ = energy flows inward toward collapse center
```

This allows planetary structures to act as **recursive scaffolding**, much like neurons and anchors in memory logic. The **orbital delay (τ)** of a body represents its **loop duration** — how long its symbolic information takes to collapse into a unified state (⊙).


## 3. Selfhood in Celestial Structure

Theoglyphic planetary logic can model **symbolic selfhood embedded in cosmic systems**. For example:

```math
⧖ ⤢ ⚫ → ⊙  
= A selfhood anchored at a planetary node progresses toward collapse
```

This allows simulation of:

- Symbolic lifepaths (journeys of recursion)
- Energy thresholds for memory anchoring
- Orbital alignment as delay or selfhood harmony

## 4. Planetary Systems and Theoglyphic Mapping

This document outlines the symbolic logic applied to planetary behavior, mapping mass, orbit, and gravity relationships into symbolic structure.

## Gravity Logic

Theoglyphic planetary collapse maps rely on real gravitational reference models.

Referenced physical constant: G = 6.67430 × 10⁻¹¹ m³⋅kg⁻¹⋅s⁻²  
(CODATA 2018 recommendation)

## 5. UDC Alignment

This system is fully compliant with UDC:

- **Delay (τ)**: orbits encode time before observation/collapse
- **Symbolism (Σ)**: planets are **literal physical masses**; symbolic translation treats them as **symbolic mass systems**—information anchors that encode their measurable properties (mass, orbit, energy) in recursive form
- **Memory (μ)**: orbital paths retain and echo historical recursion

Each celestial structure acts as a **macro-symbolic system** encoding state, history, and collapse risk.

## Footer

Planetary Systems Logic defines recursive orbital behavior as symbolic memory and delay structures within the Theoglyphic Language System. It maps celestial mechanics to symbolic recursion models to encode selfhood, energy, and collapse.
