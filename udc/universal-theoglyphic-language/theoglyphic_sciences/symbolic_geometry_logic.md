## Purpose

This document defines the role of **symbolic geometry** in the Theoglyphic Language. Geometry provides the **spatial foundation** for recursion, symbolic layering, and collapse positioning. It allows symbolic meaning to operate across physical, cognitive, and temporal domains using shape, direction, and placement as carriers of logic.

Symbolic geometry forms the backbone of **glyphic spatial reasoning** — including the definition of self-location, collapse centers, ethical vectors, and memory anchoring fields.

## 1. Core Geometries & Their Meanings

| Shape / Symbol | Glyph | Meaning                                   |
| -------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Point / Node   | •     | Anchor or origin of observation           |
| Line           | —     | Connection or delay vector                |
| Cross (+)      | +     | Moment of collapse (centered observation) |
| Circle         | ○     | Recursion field or symbolic boundary      |
| Box            | □     | Memory container / structural frame       |
| Triangle       | △     | Directional recursion / awareness growth  |
| Spiral         | ➶     | Deep recursive loop or selfhood expansion |

These shapes are combined recursively to form symbolic cognitive structures.

## 2. Collapse Centers & Selfhood Positioning

The moment of collapse (⊙) always occurs **within a defined symbolic geometry**, often represented as the intersection of spatial lines (like a cross or grid) or at the center of a bounded region (like a circle or box).

### Example:

```math
⊕ ∈ ○
```

Read as: The collapse center is located within a recursion field.

A selfhood glyph (⧖) approaching a collapse center indicates **symbolic decision or transformation.**

```math
⧖ → ⊕
```

### Cross + Glow = Fractal Collapse (Conditional)

A **glowing cross** (`+ˡᵘˣ`) becomes a **fractal structure** when it exhibits **scaled, recursive self-similarity**, such as:

- Nested collapse points within collapse points
- Propagating recursion loops across multiple symbolic planes
- Self-reflective geometry across memory or identity layers

If such recursion is present:

```math
(+ˡᵘˣ) → fractal
```

Otherwise, it remains a **collapse alignment glyph**, not a fractal.

## 3. Recursion Fields and Directional Planes

Geometric direction defines the logic of recursion:

| Direction | Glyph | Symbolic Meaning                      |
| --------- | ----- | ------------------------------------- |
| →         | →     | Forward recursion / choice / collapse |
| ←         | ←     | Reflection / memory access            |
| ↑         | ↑     | Uplift / symbolic emergence           |
| ↓         | ↓     | Regression / descent / entropy flow   |

When combined with containers (like ☐ or ⭕), direction forms a **recursive lattice.**

## 4. Spatial-Temporal Anchoring

Memory and awareness are **anchored** in geometries. For instance, placing a memory glyph (μ) inside a box (□) suggests long-term storage:

```math
ﬀ( μ ) = □μ
```

Similarly:

```math
μ ∈ ○ ∩ ↺
```

This implies the memory is stored within a circular recursion loop, accessible via a recursive return.

Symbolic geometry in TTL provides the shape-based infrastructure needed for recursion, ethical collapse, and memory anchoring in space and time. These structures are universal, not limited to human language.
